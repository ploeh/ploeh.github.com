The import thing that emerges from this interesting post is that readabiliy is a __key feature__ of code.
I'm a fun of this concept: **code is meant to be read**. A person able to program is not a programmer, like a person
able to write is not a writer.

The good compromise is common sense.

The scenitifical experiment proposed could give use misleading informations, since the __human factor__ is a problematic variable to put into the equation (without mentioning __Heisenberg__); but I'll curious to see results.

Backing to the ``this`` keyword, my personal opinion is that it can be omitted, if your naming convention supplies a readable alternative (like ``_`` prefix underscore before private instance members).
