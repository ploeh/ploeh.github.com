	<p>
		This article is part of <a href="/2020/06/08/the-io-container">an article series about the IO container in C#</a>. In the previous articles, you've seen how a type like <code>IO&lt;T&gt;</code> can be used to distinguish between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function">pure functions</a> and impure actions.
	</p>
	<p>
		The point of the article series is to illustrate the concept that <a href="https://www.haskell.org">Haskell</a> uses to impose the <a href="/2018/11/19/functional-architecture-a-definition">functional interaction law</a> at compile time. The implementation details really aren't important. Still, I believe that I know my readership well enough that a substantial fraction would be left unsatisfied if I didn't share the implementation details.
	</p>
	<p>
		I consider this an appendix to the article series. It's not really what this is all about, but here it is, nonetheless.
	</p>

		Constructor <a href="#dcf2521a1b8c40df9d45e97a43cfc546" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		Based on the public API <a href="/2020/06/15/io-container-in-a-parallel-c-universe">already published</a>, the constructor implementation hardly comes as a surprise.
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">private</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">readonly</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Func</span>&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af;">T</span>&gt;&nbsp;item;
 
<span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">IO</span>(<span style="color:#2b91af;">Func</span>&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af;">T</span>&gt;&nbsp;item)
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">this</span>.item&nbsp;=&nbsp;item;
}</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		The <code>IO&lt;T&gt;</code> class is little more than a wrapper around a lazily evaluated function, with the restriction that while you can put a <code>Func&lt;T&gt;</code> object into an <code>IO</code> object, you can never get it out again. Thus, the <code>item</code> is a <code>private</code> class field instead of a public property.
	</p>
	<h3 id="50d90cc423f04f5bb4e31a0d6c9b12c8">
		SelectMany <a href="#50d90cc423f04f5bb4e31a0d6c9b12c8" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		The <code>SelectMany</code> method is a little more tricky:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">IO</span>&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af;">TResult</span>&gt;&nbsp;SelectMany&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af;">TResult</span>&gt;(<span style="color:#2b91af;">Func</span>&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af;">T</span>,&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">IO</span>&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af;">TResult</span>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;selector)
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">return</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">new</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">IO</span>&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af;">TResult</span>&gt;(()&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;selector(item()).item());
}</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		To guarantee <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_transparency">referential transparency</a>, we don't want the method to trigger evaluation of the lazy value, so the <code>selector</code> has to run inside a new lazy computation. This produces a lazy <code>IO</code> value that the method then has to unwrap inside another lazy computation. Such a translation from <code>Func&lt;IO&lt;TResult&gt;&gt;</code> to a new <code>IO</code> object with a <code>Func&lt;TResult&gt;</code> inside it is reminiscent of what in Haskell is known as a <em>traversal</em>.
	</p>
	<h3 id="b6c088710f6340689376b0ddf3b7df01">
		UnsafePerformIO <a href="#b6c088710f6340689376b0ddf3b7df01" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		Finally, the <code>UnsafePerformIO</code> method isn't part of the API, but as explained in the <a href="/2020/07/06/referential-transparency-of-io">previous article</a>, this is the special method that the hypothetical parallel-world framework calls on the <code>IO&lt;Unit&gt;</code> returned by <code>Main</code> methods.
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">internal</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">T</span>&nbsp;UnsafePerformIO()
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">return</span>&nbsp;item();
}</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		Since only the framework is supposed to call this method, it's <code>internal</code> by design. The only thing it does is to force evaluation of the lazy <code>item</code>.
	</p>
	<h3 id="38830b00fbbf4911b8a7ebd723e138ea">
		Conclusion <a href="#38830b00fbbf4911b8a7ebd723e138ea" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		Most of the implementation of <code>IO&lt;T&gt;</code> is straightforward, with the single exception of <code>SelectMany</code>, which has to jump through a few hoops to keep the behaviour lazy until it's activated.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once more I want to point out that the purpose of this article series is to explain how a type system like Haskell's guarantees referential transparency. C# could do the same, but it'd require that all impure actions in all libraries in the entire .NET ecosystem were to return <code>IO</code> values. That's not going to happen, but something similar already has happened. Read on in the next article.

				In your <a href="https://blog.ploeh.dk/2020/07/13/implementation-of-the-c-io-container/">previous post</a>, you said
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				Haskell is a lazily evaluated language. That's an important piece of the puzzle, so I've modelled the <code>IO&lt;T&gt;</code> example so that it only wraps <code>Lazy</code> values. That emulates Haskell's behaviour in C#.
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				After several days, I finally feel like I fully understand this.
			</p>
			<p>
				The concept of lazy has serveral slightly different definitions depending on the context.  Haskell is a lazily evaluated language in the sense that its evaluation strategy is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation_strategy#Call_by_need">call by need</a>.  In C#, both <code>Lazy&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>Func&lt;T&gt;</code> are lazy in the sense that neither actually contains a <code>T</code>, but both could produce a <code>T</code> if asked to do so.  The difference is the presence or absence of caching.  I remember all this by saying that <code>Lazy&lt;T&gt;</code> is lazy with caching and <code>Func&lt;T&gt;</code> is lazy without caching.  So <code>Lazy&lt;T&gt;</code> is to call by need as <code>Func&lt;T&gt;</code> is to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation_strategy#Call_by_name">call by name</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Therefore, <code>Lazy&lt;T&gt;</code> is the correct choice if we want to model or emulate the evaluation strategy of Haskell in C#.  What about Haskell's <code>IO&lt;T&gt;</code>?  Is it lazy with caching or lazy without caching?  My guess was lazy without caching, but I finally installed the ghc Haskell compiler and compiled Haskell on my machine for the first time in order to test this.  I think this example shows that Haskell's <code>IO&lt;T&gt;</code> is lazy without caching.
			</p>
			<p>
				<pre>-- output: xx
main = 
  let io = putStr "x"
  in do { io ; io }</pre>
			</p>
			<p>
				I think this would be equivalent C# code in this parallel world that you have created.
			</p>
			<p>
				<pre>// output: x
static IO<unit> MainIO(string[] args) {
  var io = Console.Write("x");
  return from _1 in io
         from _2 in io
         select Unit.Instance;
}</unit></pre>
			</p>
			<p>
				What makes me think that I fully understand this now is that I think I see where you are going.  I think you already knew all this and decided to model Haskell's <code>IO&lt;T&gt;</code> using <code>Lazy&lt;T&gt;</code> anyway because <code>Task&lt;T&gt;</code> is also lazy with caching just like <code>Lazy&lt;T&gt;</code>, and your next post will discuss using <code>Task&lt;T&gt;</code> as a surrogate for Haskell's <code>IO&lt;T&gt;</code>.  I think you want your C# implementation of <code>IO&lt;T&gt;</code> to be more like C#'s <code>Task&lt;T&gt;</code> than Haskell's <code>IO&lt;T&gt;</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Thank you for including such a gem for me to think about...and enough motivation to finally put Haskell on my machine!

				Tyson, thank you for writing. You've almost turned my blog into a peer-reviewed journal, and you've just pointed out a major blunder of mine 👍
			</p>
			<p>
				I think I was mislead by the name <code>Lazy</code>, my attention was elsewhere, and I completely forgot about the memoisation that both <code>Lazy&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>Task&lt;T&gt;</code> employ. It does turn out to be problematic in this context. Take the following example:
			</p>
			<p>
				<pre><span style="color:blue;">static</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">IO</span>&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Unit</span>&gt;&nbsp;Main(<span style="color:blue;">string</span>[]&nbsp;args)
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">IO</span>&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af;">DateTime</span>&gt;&nbsp;getTime&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Clock</span>.GetLocalTime();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">return</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;getTime.SelectMany(t1&nbsp;=&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Console</span>.WriteLine(t1.Ticks.ToString()).Select(u1&nbsp;=&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Thread</span>.Sleep(2);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">return</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Unit</span>.Instance;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}).SelectMany(u2&nbsp;=&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;getTime).SelectMany(t2&nbsp;=&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Console</span>.WriteLine(t2.Ticks.ToString())));
}</pre>
			</p>
			<p>
				Notice that this example <em>reuses</em> <code>getTime</code> twice. We'd like any <code>IO&lt;T&gt;</code> value to represent an impure computation, so evaluating it twice with a 2 millisecond delay in between ought to yield two different results.
			</p>
			<p>
				Due to the memoisation built into <code>Lazy&lt;T&gt;</code>, the first value is reused. That's not the behaviour we'd like to see.
			</p>
			<p>
				While this is a rather big error on my part, it's fortunately only of a technical nature (I think). As you imply, the correct implementation is to use <code>Func&lt;T&gt;</code> rather than <code>Lazy&lt;T&gt;</code>:
			</p>
			<p>
				<pre><span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">sealed</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">class</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">IO</span>&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af;">T</span>&gt;
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">private</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">readonly</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Func</span>&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af;">T</span>&gt;&nbsp;item;
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">IO</span>(<span style="color:#2b91af;">Func</span>&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af;">T</span>&gt;&nbsp;item)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">this</span>.item&nbsp;=&nbsp;item;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">IO</span>&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af;">TResult</span>&gt;&nbsp;SelectMany&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af;">TResult</span>&gt;(<span style="color:#2b91af;">Func</span>&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af;">T</span>,&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">IO</span>&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af;">TResult</span>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;selector)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">return</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">new</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">IO</span>&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af;">TResult</span>&gt;(()&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;selector(item()).item());
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">internal</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">T</span>&nbsp;UnsafePerformIO()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">return</span>&nbsp;item();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
}</pre>
			</p>
			<p>
				This addresses the above reuse bug. With this implementation, the above <code>Main</code> method prints two different values, even though it reuses <code>getTime</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Haskell <code>IO</code> doesn't memoise values, so this <code>Func</code>-based implementation better emulates the Haskell behaviour, which is actually what I wanted to do all along.
			</p>
			<p>
				This mistake of mine is potentially so confusing that I think that it's best if I go back and edit the other posts in this articles series. Before I do that, though, I'd like to get your feedback.
			</p>
			<p>
				Does this look better to you, or do you see other problems with it?

			<p>
				Yes, your <code>Func&lt;T&gt;</code>-based implementation better emulates Haskell's <code>IO&lt;T&gt;</code>.  My guess was that you had used <code>Lazy&lt;T&gt;</code> with its caching behavior in mind.  I do think it is a minor issue.  I can't think of any code that I would write on purpose that would depend on this difference.
			</p>
			<p>
				I think editing the previous posts depends on exactly how you want to suggesst <code>Task&lt;T&gt;</code> as an <code>IO&lt;T&gt;</code> surrogate.
			</p>
			<p>
				From a purely teaching perspective, I think I prefer to first implement Haskell's <code>IO&lt;T&gt;</code> in C# using <code>Func&lt;T&gt;</code>, then suggest this implemention is essentialy the same as <code>Task&lt;T&gt;</code>, then point out the caching difference for those that are still reading.  It would be a shame to lose some readers eariler by pointing out the difference too soon.  I wouldn't expect you lost any readres in your current presentation that includes the caching difference but without mentioning it.
			</p>
			<p>
				<code>Func&lt;T&gt;</code>, <code>Lazy&lt;T&gt;</code>, and <code>Task&lt;T&gt;</code> are all lazy (in the sense that none contain a <code>T</code> but all could produce one if requested.  Here are their differences:
				<ul>
					<li><code>Func&lt;T&gt;</code> is synchronous without caching,</li>
					<li><code>Lazy&lt;T&gt;</code> is synchronous with caching, and</li>
					<li><code>Task&lt;T&gt;</code> is asynchronous with caching.</li>
				</ul>
                We are missing a type that is asynchronous without caching.  We can create such behavior though using <code>Func&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>Task&lt;T&gt;</code>.  The nested type <code>Func&lt;Task&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> can asynchronously produce a <code>T</code> without caching.  Maybe this would be helpful in this article series.
			</p>
			<p>
				Overall though, I don't know of any other potential changes to consider.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
}</pre>
			</p>
			<p>
				As this discussion reveals, the memoisation performed by <code>Lazy&lt;T&gt;</code> causes problems. After thinking it through, I've decided to retroactively change the articles in the series. This is something that I rarely do, but in this case I think is the best way forward, as the <code>Lazy</code>-based implementation could be confusing to new readers.
