<div id="post">
	<p>Now that <a href="http://amzn.to/12p90MG">my book</a> about Dependency Injection is out, it's only fitting that I also invert my own dependencies by striking out as an independent consultant/advisor. In the future I'm hoping to combine my writing and speaking efforts, as well as my open source interests, with helping out clients write better code.</p> <p>If you'd like to get help with Dependency Injection or Test-Driven Development, SOLID, API design, application architecture or one of the other topics I regularly cover here on my blog, I'm available as a consultant worldwide.</p> <p>When it comes to Windows Azure, I'll be renewing my alliance with my penultimate employer <a href="http://www.commentor.dk/">Commentor</a>, so you can also hire me as part of larger deal with Commentor.</p> <p>In case you are wondering what happened to <a href="/2011/08/01/JoiningAppHarbor">my employment with AppHarbor</a>, I resigned from my position there because I couldn't make it work with all the other things I also would like to do. I still think <a href="http://appharbor.com">AppHarbor</a> is a very interesting project, and I wish my former employers the best of luck with their endeavor.</p> <p>This has been a message from the blog's sponsor (myself). Soon, regular content will resume.</p>

Best of luck to you, I'll be reading the blog as always.<br>

BTW - Got the physical book finally, even though I'm no newb of IoC and such, I'd have loved a solid read when I was learning about the options back in the day.  ;)<br>

Cheers!</div>
