	<p>Encapsulation is one of the most misunderstood aspects of object-oriented programming. Most people seem to think that the related concept of <em>information hiding</em> simply means that private fields should be exposed by public properties (or getter/setter methods in languages that don't have native properties).</p> <p>Have you ever wondered what's the <em>real</em> benefit to be derived from code like the following?</p>
	<p>
		<pre style="margin: 0px"><span style="color: "><font color="#0000ff"><font style="font-size: 10pt">private</font></font></span><font style="font-size: 10pt"> <span style="color: "><font color="#0000ff">string</font></span> name;</font>
<span style="color: "><font color="#0000ff"><font style="font-size: 10pt">public</font></font></span><font style="font-size: 10pt"> <span style="color: "><font color="#0000ff">string</font></span> Name</font>
<font style="font-size: 10pt">{</font>
<font style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: "><font color="#0000ff">get</font></span> { <span style="color: "><font color="#0000ff">return</font></span> <span style="color: "><font color="#0000ff">this</font></span>.name; }</font>
<font style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: "><font color="#0000ff">set</font></span> { <span style="color: "><font color="#0000ff">this</font></span>.name = <span style="color: "><font color="#0000ff">value</font></span>; }</font>
<font style="font-size: 10pt">}</font></pre>
</p>
<p>This feels awfully much like redundant code to me (and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb384054.aspx">automatic properties</a> are not the answer  -  it's just a compiler trick that still creates private backing fields). No information is actually hidden. <a href="http://lostechies.com/derickbailey/">Derick Bailey</a> has a <a href="http://lostechies.com/derickbailey/2011/03/28/encapsulation-youre-doing-it-wrong/">good piece on why this view of encapsulation is too narrow</a>, so I'm not going to reiterate all his points here.</p>
<p>So then what <em>is</em> encapsulation?</p>
<p>The whole point of object-orientation is to produce cohesive pieces of code (classes) that solve given problems once and for all, so that programmers can use those classes without having to learn about the intricate details of the implementations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is what encapsulation is all about: exposing a solution to a problem without requiring the consumer to fully understand the problem domain.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is what all well-designed classes do.</p>
<ul>
<li>You don't have to know the intricate details of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabular_Data_Stream">TDS</a> to use ADO.NET against SQL Server. 
<li>You don't have to know the intricate details of painting on the screen to use WPF or Windows Forms. 
<li>You don't have to know the intricate details of Reflection to use a DI Container. 
<li>You don't have to know how to efficiently sort a list in order to efficiently sort a list in .NET. 
<li>Etc.</li></ul>
<p>What makes encapsulation so important is exactly this trait. The class must hide the information it encapsulates in order to protect it against ‘naïve' users. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_%28object-oriented_programming%29">Wikipedia has this to say</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hiding the internals of the object protects its integrity by preventing users from setting the internal data of the component into an invalid or inconsistent state.</p></blockquote>
<p>Keep in mind that users are <em>expected</em> to not fully understand the internal implementation of a class. This makes it obvious what encapsulation is really about:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Encapsulation is a fail-safe mechanism.</p></blockquote>
<p>By corollary, encapsulation does <em>not</em> mean hiding complexity. Whenever complexity is hidden (<a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2011/04/27/Providerisnotapattern">as is the case for Providers</a>) feedback time increases. Rapid feedback is much preferred, so delaying feedback is not desirable if it can be avoided.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Encapsulation is not about hiding complexity, but conversely exposing complexity in a fail-safe manner.</p></blockquote>
<p>In Lean this is known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poka-yoke">Poka-yoke</a>, so I find it only fitting to think about encapsulation as <em>Poka-yoke Design</em>: APIs that make it as hard as possible to do the wrong thing. Considering that <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2011/04/29/Feedbackmechanismsandtradeoffs">compilation is the cheapest feedback mechanism</a>, it's preferable to design APIs so that the code can only compile when classes are used correctly.</p>
<p>In a series of blog posts I will look at various design smells that break encapsulation, as well as provide guidance on how to improve the design to make it safer, thus going from smell to fragrance.</p>

	<div class="comment-content">Perhaps it would be beneficial to elaborate on your focus here by describing when/where these &quot;smells&quot; are applicable. With the .NET community (as a whole) only recently coming on to topics like anemic models, I fear that they will take this advice and apply it to every scenario.<br>
<br>
That's not to say that this is not relevant information but surely you're not implying that's applicable to scenarios like messaging, RESTful APIs, and other circumstances that need easily serializable objecst? </div>

	<div class="comment-content">You're still doing it wrong. Encapsulation means that, instead of exposing data, you expose an interface that exports exactly the operations and values that are defined for your class.<br>
<br>
For instance, if a string name is used as a sorting key, it isn't appropriate to change the name. You can make the name string public, but that implies that changing the name is a valid operation, and might lead to bugs later. Providing a const getter, but no setter for the name says &quot;You can't change this name&quot;.<br>
<br>
If you have a setter and a getter for a piece of data, it should be because the class needs to expose that data for the purpose of changing it. That happens a lot, and it shouldn't be viewed as unreasonable that you have a private data member and a setter/getter. It's not a waste of time or code. It's a clear contract with users of your class that you intend to provide these operations no matter how the class evolves.<br>
<br>
One important property of good encapsulation is that you are free to change the data representation of your class if the interface remains the same, and your changes will be limited to the methods of the class itself. Want to change from a 1-based count to a zero-based index? If you exposed a member called items, you're screwed. If you exposed a method called CountGet() you're ok. Just change CountGet()'s implementation from returning items to return items+1. </div>

	<div class="comment-content">One thing at a time... There's a reason I themed this series of blog posts around fail-safing. I agree that encapsulation involves more than just that, but I don't think I ever said anything else.</div>

	<div class="comment-content">Interesting post. A few years ago I did some research on the &quot;absence of proper encapsulation language features&quot; in C# and Java. It's an interesting approach to advance from smells to fragrance, pointing out code snippets that potentially violate encapsulation in some way. But - to be honest - this will help only those people that are even aware of these problems. <br>
You mentioned the compiler as the first and cheapest feedback mechanism, so the target should be to achieve automation of the process of enforcing proper encapsulation with (a) a better compiler or (b) static analysis or (c) runtime functionality that can be applied minimally-invasive. <br>
See C++'s const qualifier, an excellent example of a language feature to support proper encapsulation, this would allow for e.g. auto-properties with a getter/setter when making the setter const. Of course this will itself impact your design, but it offers a language integrated fail-safe mechanism for encapsulation. What do you think?<br>
I also may have an additional smell for you, a violation of the law of demeter breaks encapsulation in most cases. </div>

	<div class="comment-content">Florian, I agree with your statement about Law of Demeter, although Fowler calls it 'the occasionally useful suggestion of Demeter' (or some such thing).<br>
<br>
I don't have any comment on the C++ const qualifier, as I have no idea what it does...</div>

<br>
first of all I have to correct my first comment, auto properties with a const setter is definitely non-sense. <br>
The C++ const qualifier is effectively a statically checked and compiler-enforced construct to syntactically express your objectives regarding &quot;permissions&quot; to change an object's state. <br>
If I e.g. declare a class A with a const method. Every caller calling the const method knows, that wahtever the method itself does, it will definitely not change the state of the object - imagine you have a immutable 'this' in your const method. <br>
The same holds for e.g. a parameter that is passed to a method. If the parameter is declared const, the compiler will enforce that the parameter (be it a value or reference type) will not be changed.<br>
But the real problem with every object that is owned by another object and exposed in some way(e.g. property getter), is, that when I return a reference to it, the caller that received the reference can change this object's state without me knowing it - this breaks encapsulation. The const qualifier comes to the rescue, when I return a const reference, the caller cannot change the returned object (compiler-checked!). <br>
<br>
Although the const qualifier does not solve all the problems you mentioned in your blog, it can be of help. I actually only brought your attention to this C++ language construct to have an example in hand (I'm far away from a C++ expert) for what I meant with &quot;automation of the process of enforcing proper encapsulation&quot;. I'm still interested in your opinion regarding efforts on automation of these things...<br>

	<div class="comment-content">Sounds useful. Currently, Microsoft is making an effort along the same lines with Code Contracts, but although it's actually a released technology it still seems a bit immature to me.<br>
<br>
As I've been using TDD since 2003 I usually just codify my assumptions about invariants in the tests I write. A framework like Greg Young's Grensesnitt might also come in handy there.</div>
