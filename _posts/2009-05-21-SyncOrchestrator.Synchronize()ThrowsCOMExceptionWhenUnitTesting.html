title: "SyncOrchestrator.Synchronize() Throws COMException When Unit Testing"

<div id="post">
	<p>
		This post describes a particular problem I ran into when working with the Microsoft Sync Framework. Since I found a solution, I'm sharing it here to help others. If you are not having this particular problem, it's quite safe to skip reading the rest of the post :)
	</p>
	<p>
		While developing a SyncProvider, I wanted to create and execute a series of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ploeh/archive/2006/08/27/727211.aspx">Integration Tests</a> to drive my development effort. In order to do that, I wrote a simple test that simply created a SyncOrchestrator instance and invoked its Synchronize method.
	</p>
	<p>
		Running this test gave me this error message:
	</p>
	<p>
		“Microsoft.Synchronization.SyncException: Retrieving the COM class factory for component with CLSID {A7B3B4EE-925C-4D6C-B007-A4A6A0B09143} failed due to the following error: 80040154. ---&gt;&nbsp; System.Runtime.InteropServices.COMException: Retrieving the COM class factory for component with CLSID {A7B3B4EE-925C-4D6C-B007-A4A6A0B09143} failed due to the following error: 80040154.”
	</p>
	<p>
		It's not often I see a COMException these days, so I was initially baffled. Since the Sync Framework also has an unmanaged API, this is really not surprising, but that didn't help me solve my problem.
	</p>
	<p>
		What was even weirder was that when I tried running the same code in my application, this exception was <em>not</em> being thrown.
	</p>
	<p>
		It took me a couple of hours to figure out what the problem was.
	</p>
	<p>
		Here's a little hint: I'm running Windows Vista x64.
	</p>
	<p>
		No: The issue is not that I'm running Vista :)
	</p>
	<p>
		Even on x64, Visual Studio runs as a 32-bit process, and so does MSTest. Since my code was compiled to <em>Any CPU</em>, the application itself was running in a 64-bit process, whereas my unit test was running in a 32-bit process.
	</p>
	<p>
		I tried changing my build output to x86, and now the application started throwing the same exception as the unit test did.
	</p>
	<p>
		In other words: When running in a 64-bit process, everything worked as intended. When running in a 32-bit process, a COMException was thrown.
	</p>
	<p>
		As it turned out, I had only installed the 64-bit version of the Sync Framework, and even though the SDK seems to contain builds for the other architectures as well, the COM Server wasn't properly registered for 32-bit use.
	</p>
	<p>
		To resolve this issue, I downloaded and installed the x86 version of the Sync Framework as well, and the problem went away.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you are having the same problem, I hope this post helps you resolve it.

I was trying to find out why SharePoint Workspace did not work on my workstation.  It was failing with the &quot;Class not found&quot; 80040154 error, and I found your article with a Google search on the CLSID.  Installing Microsoft Sync Framework 1.0 SP1 fixed the problem, and I would never have known where to look without your article.</div>
