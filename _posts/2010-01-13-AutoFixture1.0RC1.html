<div id="post">
	<p><a href="http://autofixture.codeplex.com/">AutoFixture</a> 1.0 Release Candidate 1 is now available on the CodePlex site! AutoFixture is now almost ten months old and has seen extensive use internally in <a href="http://www.safewhere.net/">Safewhere</a> during most of this time. It has proven to be very stable, expressive and generally a delight to use.</p> <p>If all goes well, the Release Candidate period will be short. Key users have a chance to veto the this version, but if no-one complains within a week from now, we will promote RC1 to version 1.0.</p> <p>The <a href="http://autofixture.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=38665">RC1 release page</a> has more detail about this particular release.</p>
