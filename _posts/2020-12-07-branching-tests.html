	<p>
		When I coach development organisations about unit testing and test-driven development, there's often a sizeable group of developers who don't see the value of unit testing. Some of the arguments they typically use are worth considering.
	</p>
	<p>
		A common complaint is that it's difficult to see the wisdom in writing code to prevent defects in code. That's not an unreasonable objection.
	</p>
	<p>
		<a href="/2020/05/25/wheres-the-science">We have scant scientific knowledge about software engineering</a>, but the little we know suggests that the number of defects is proportional to lines of code. The more lines of code, the more defects.
	</p>
	<p>
		If that's true, adding more code - even when it's test code - seems like a bad idea.

		Reasons to trust test code <a href="#88c3fa7503454d9f9e329db299f70881" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		First, we should consider the possibility that the correlation between lines of code and defects doesn't mean that defects are <em>evenly</em> distributed. As <a href="https://www.adamtornhill.com">Adam Tornhill</a> argues in <a href="https://amzn.to/36Pd5EE">Your Code as a Crime Scene</a>, defects tend to cluster in hotspots.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can have a large proportion of your code base which is, for all intents and purpose, bug-free, and hotspots where defects keep spawning.
	</p>
	<p>
		If this is true, adding test code isn't a problem if you can keep it bug-free.
	</p>
	<p>
		That, however, sounds like a chicken-and-the-egg kind of problem. How can you know that test code is bug-free without tests?
	</p>
	<p>
		I've <a href="/2013/04/02/why-trust-tests">previously answered that question</a>. In short, you can trust a test for two reasons:
		<ul>
			<li>You've seen it fail (haven't you?)</li>
			<li>It's simple</li>
		</ul>
		I usually think of the simplicity criterion as a limit on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity">cyclomatic complexity</a>: it should be <em>1</em>. This means no branching and no loops in your tests.
	</p>
	<p>
		That's what this article is actually about.

		I was working with an online restaurant reservation system (example code), and had written this test:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dto.Quantity);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Assert</span>.Contains(expected,&nbsp;db);
}</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		This is a <a href="/2019/02/18/from-interaction-based-to-state-based-testing">state-based test</a> that verifies that a valid reservation makes it to the database. The test has a cyclomatic complexity of <em>1</em>, and I've seen it fail, so all is good. (It may, in fact, contain a future maintenance problem, but that's a topic for <a href="/2021/01/11/waiting-to-happen">another article</a>.)
	</p>
	<p>
		<ins datetime="2021-07-13T06:34Z">The code shown here is part of the sample code base that accompanies my book <a href="/code-that-fits-in-your-head">Code That Fits in Your Head</a>.</ins>
	</p>
	<p>
		What constitutes a valid reservation? At the very least, we should demand that <code>At</code> is a valid date and time, and that <code>Quantity</code> is a positive number. The restaurant would like to be able to email a confirmation to the user, so an email address is also required. Email addresses are notoriously difficult to validate, so we'll just require that the the string isn't null.
	</p>
	<p>
		What about the <code>Name</code>? I thought about this a bit and decided that, according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle">Postel's law</a>, the system should accept null names. The name is only a convenience; the system doesn't need it, it's just there so that when you arrive at the restaurant, you can say <em>"I have a reservation for Julia"</em> instead of giving an email address to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma%C3%AEtre_d%27h%C3%B4tel">maître d'hôtel</a>. But then, if you didn't supply a name when you made the reservation, you can always state your email address when you arrive. To summarise, the name is just a convenience, not a requirement.
	</p>
	<p>
		This decision meant that I ought to write a test case with a null name.
	</p>
	<p>
		That turned out to present a problem. I'd defined the <code>Reservation</code> class so that it didn't accept <code>null</code> arguments, and I think that's the appropriate design. Null is just evil and has no place in my domain models.
	</p>
	<p>
		That's not a problem in itself. In this case, I think it's acceptable to convert a null name to the empty string.
	</p>

	</h3>
	<p>
		Allow me to summarise. If you consider the above unit test, I needed a third test case with a null <code>name</code>. In that case, <code>expected</code> should be a <code>Reservation</code> value with the name <code>""</code>. Not <code>null</code>, but <code>""</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		As far as I can tell, you can't easily express that in <code>PostValidReservationWhenDatabaseIsEmpty</code> without increasing its cyclomatic complexity. Based on the above introduction, that seems like a no-no.
	</p>
	<p>
		What's the alternative? Should I copy the test and adjust the <em>single</em> line of code that differs? If I did, it would look like this:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Assert</span>.Contains(expected,&nbsp;db);
}</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		Apart from the values in the <code>[InlineData]</code> attribute and the method name, the <em>only</em> difference from <code>PostValidReservationWhenDatabaseIsEmpty</code> is that <code>expected</code> has a hard-coded name of <code>""</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		This is not acceptable.
	</p>
	<p>
		There's a common misconception that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY</a> principle doesn't apply to unit tests. I don't see why this should be true. The DRY principle exists because copy-and-paste code is difficult to maintain. Unit test code is also code that you have to maintain. All the rules about writing maintainable code also apply to unit test code.

	<p>
		What's the alternative? One option (that shouldn't be easily dismissed) is to introduce a <a href="http://xunitpatterns.com/Test%20Helper.html">Test Helper</a> to perform the conversion from a nullable name to a non-nullable name. Such a helper would have a cyclomatic complexity of <em>2</em>, but could be unit tested in isolation. It might even turn out that it'd be useful in the production code.
	</p>
	<p>
		Still, that seems like overkill, so I instead made the taboo move and added branching logic to the existing test to see how it'd look:

	</p>
	<p>
		Notice that the <code>expected</code> name is now computed as <code>dto.Name ?? ""</code>. Perhaps you think about branching instructions as relating exclusively to keywords such as <code>if</code> or <code>switch</code>, but the <code>??</code> operator is also a branching instruction. The test now has a cyclomatic complexity of <code>2</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Is that okay?

		To branch or not to branch <a href="#baf81334614241e7b36bbe7f8f1af821" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		I think that in this case, it's okay to slightly increase the cyclomatic complexity of the test. It's not something I just pull out of my hat, though. I think it's possible to adjust the above heuristics to embrace this sort of variation.
	</p>
	<p>
		To be clear, I consider this an <em>advanced</em> practice. If you're just getting started with unit testing, try to keep tests simple. Keep the cyclomatic complexity at <em>1</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Had I been in the above situation a couple of years ago, I might not have considered this option. About a year ago, though, I watched <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hughes_(computer_scientist)">John Hughes'</a> presentation <a href="https://youtu.be/NcJOiQlzlXQ">Building on developers' intuitions to create effective property-based tests</a>. When he, about 15 minutes in, wrote a test with a branching instruction, I remember becoming quite uncomfortable. This lasted for a while until I understood where he was going with it. It's truly an inspiring and illuminating talk; I highly recommend it.
	</p>
	<p>
		How it relates to the problem presented here is through <em>coverage</em>. While the <code>PostValidReservationWhenDatabaseIsEmpty</code> test now has a cyclomatic complexity of <em>2</em>, it's a parametrised test with three test cases. Two of these cover one branch, and the third covers the other.
	</p>
	<p>
		What's more important is the process that produced the test. I added one test case at a time, and for each case, <em>I saw the test fail</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Specifically, when I added the third test case with the null name, I first added the branching expression <code>dto.Name ?? ""</code> and ran the two existing tests. They still both passed, which bolstered my belief that they both exercised the left branch of that expression. I then added the third case and saw that it (and only it) failed. This supported my belief that the third case exercised the right branch of <code>??</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Branching in unit tests isn't something I do lightly. I still believe that it could make the test more vulnerable to future changes. I'm particularly worried about making a future change that might shift one or more of these test cases into false negatives in the form of <a href="/2019/10/14/tautological-assertion">tautological assertions</a>.

		Conclusion <a href="#bfa3a3d3f82044f289568efcc675c70f" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		As you can tell, when I feel that I'm moving onto thin ice, I move deliberately. If there's one thing I've learned from decades of professional programming it's that my brain loves jumping to conclusions. Moving slowly and deliberately is my attempt at countering this tendency. I believe that it enables me to go faster in the long run.
	</p>
	<p>
		I don't think that branching in unit tests should be common, but I believe that it may be occasionally valid. The key, I think, is to guarantee that each branch in the test is covered by a test case. The implication is that there must be <em>at least</em> as many test cases as the cyclomatic complexity. In other words, the test <em>must</em> be a parametrised test.

			<p>Hi Mark, I guess there is 
                implicit cyclomatic complexity in the testing framework itself (For example,
                it loops through the <code>InlineData</code> records). That feels fine though, does this 
                somehow have less cost than cyclomatic complexity in the test code itself?
                I guess, as you mentioned, it's acceptable because the alternative is violation of DRY.
			</p>
			<p>
                With this in mind, I wonder how you feel about adding
                an <code>expectedName</code> parameter to the <code>InlineData</code> 
                attributes, instead of the conditional in the test code? Maybe it's 
                harder to read though when the test data includes input and output.

				James, thank you for writing. I consider <a href="/2019/12/09/put-cyclomatic-complexity-to-good-use#de927bfcc95d410bbfcd0adf7a63926b">the cyclomatic complexity of a method call to be <em>1</em></a>, and Visual Studio code metrics agree with me. Whatever happens in a framework should, in my opinion, likewise be considered as encapsulated abstraction that's none of our business.
			</p>
			<p>
				Adding an <code>expectedName</code> parameter to the method is definitely an option. I sometimes do that, and I could have done that here, too. In this situation, I think it's a toss-up. It'd make it harder for a later reader of the code to parse the test cases, but would simplify the test code itself, so that alternative comes with both advantages and disadvantages.

				Hi Mark. To build up on the additional <code>expectedName</code> parameter, instead of keeping a single test with the 3 cases but the last being a edge case, I prefer introduce a specific test for the last case.
			</p>
			<p>
				Then, to remove the duplication, we can extract a common method which will take this additional <code>expectedName</code> parameter:

				Romain, thank you for writing. There are, indeed, many ways to skin that cat. If you're comfortable with distributing a test over more than one method, I instead prefer to use another data source for the <code>[Theory]</code> attribute:

				Whether you prefer one over the other is, I think, subjective. I like my alternative, using a <code>[ClassData]</code> source, better, because I find it a bit more principled and 'pattern-based', if you will. I also like how small the actual test method becomes.
			</p>
			<p>
				Your solution, on the other hand, is more portable, in the sense that you could also apply it in a testing framework that doesn't have the sort of capability that xUnit.net has. That's a definite benefit with your suggestion.
