        There still seems to be some confusion about what is <em>Dependency Injection</em> (DI) and what is a <em>DI Container</em>, so in this post I will try to sort it out as explicitly as possible.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            DI is a set of principles and patterns that enable loose coupling.

    <p>
        That's it; nothing else. Remember that old quote from p. 18 of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns_%28book%29">Design Patterns</a>?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            <em>Program to an interface; not an implementation.</em>
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        This is the concern that DI addresses. The most useful DI pattern is <em>Constructor Injection</em> where we inject dependencies into consumers via their constructors. No container is required to do this.
    </p>
    <p>
        The easiest way to build a DI-friendly application is to just use Constructor Injection all the way. Conversely, <em>an application does not automatically become loosely coupled when we use a DI Container</em>. Every time application code <em>queries</em> a container we have an instance of the <a href="/2010/02/03/ServiceLocatorisanAnti-Pattern">Service Locator anti-pattern</a>. The corollary leads to this variation of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_Principle">Hollywood Principle</a>:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            Don't call the container; it'll call you.
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        A DI Container is a fantastic tool. It's like a (motorized) mixer: you can whip cream by hand, but it's easier with a mixer. On the other hand, without the cream the mixer is nothing. The same is true for a DI Container: to really be valuable, your code must employ Constructor Injection so that the container can <em>auto-wire</em> dependencies.
    </p>
    <p>
        A well-designed application adheres to the Hollywood Principle for DI Containers: it doesn't call the container. On the other hand, we can use the container to compose the application  -  or we can do it the hard way; this is called <del datetime="2025-05-23"><em>Poor Man's DI</em></del><ins datetime="2025-05-23"> <a href="/2014/06/10/pure-di">Pure DI</a></ins>. Here's an example that uses <del datetime="2025-05-23">Poor Man's DI</del><ins datetime="2025-05-23"> Pure DI</ins> to compose a complete application graph in a console application:
    </p>
      <p>
          <pre style="margin: 0px"><span style="color: blue">private</span> <span style="color: blue">static</span> <span style="color: blue">void</span> Main(<span style="color: blue">string</span>[] args)
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue">var</span> msgWriter = <span style="color: blue">new</span> <span style="color: #2b91af">ConsoleMessageWriter</span>();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue">new</span> <span style="color: #2b91af">CoalescingParserSelector</span>(
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue">new</span> <span style="color: #2b91af">IParser</span>[]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue">new</span> <span style="color: #2b91af">HelpParser</span>(msgWriter),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue">new</span> <span style="color: #2b91af">WineInformationParser</span>(
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue">new</span> <span style="color: #2b91af">SqlWineRepository</span>(),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; msgWriter)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; })
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Parse(args)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .CreateCommand()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Execute();
}</pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        Notice how the nested structure of all the dependencies gives you an almost visual idea about the graph. What we have here is Constructor Injection all the way in.
    </p>
    <p>
        CoalescingParserSelector's constructor takes an IEnumerable&lt;IParser&gt; as input. Both HelpParser and WineInformationParser requires an IMessageWriter, and WineInformationParser also an IWineRepository. We even pull in types from different assemblies because SqlWineRepository is defined in the SQL Server-based data access assembly.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another thing to notice is that the <em>msgWriter</em> variable is shared among two consumers. This is what a DI Container normally addresses with its ability to manage <em>component lifetime</em>. Although there's not a DI Container in sight, we could certainly benefit from one. Let's try to wire up the same graph using <a href="http://unity.codeplex.com/">Unity</a> (just for kicks):
    </p>
    <p>
        <pre style="margin: 0px"><span style="color: blue">private</span> <span style="color: blue">static</span> <span style="color: blue">void</span> Main(<span style="color: blue">string</span>[] args)
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue">var</span> container = <span style="color: blue">new</span> <span style="color: #2b91af">UnityContainer</span>();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; container.RegisterType&lt;<span style="color: #2b91af">IParser</span>, <span style="color: #2b91af">WineInformationParser</span>&gt;(<span style="color: #a31515">"parser.info"</span>);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; container.RegisterType&lt;<span style="color: #2b91af">IParser</span>, <span style="color: #2b91af">HelpParser</span>&gt;(<span style="color: #a31515">"parser.help"</span>);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; container.RegisterType&lt;<span style="color: #2b91af">IEnumerable</span>&lt;<span style="color: #2b91af">IParser</span>&gt;, <span style="color: #2b91af">IParser</span>[]&gt;();
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; container.RegisterType&lt;<span style="color: #2b91af">IParseService</span>, <span style="color: #2b91af">CoalescingParserSelector</span>&gt;();
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; container.RegisterType&lt;<span style="color: #2b91af">IWineRepository</span>, <span style="color: #2b91af">SqlWineRepository</span>&gt;();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; container.RegisterType&lt;<span style="color: #2b91af">IMessageWriter</span>, <span style="color: #2b91af">ConsoleMessageWriter</span>&gt;(
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue">new</span> <span style="color: #2b91af">ContainerControlledLifetimeManager</span>());
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; container.Resolve&lt;<span style="color: #2b91af">IParseService</span>&gt;()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Parse(args)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .CreateCommand()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Execute();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; container.Dispose();
}</pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        We are using Constructor Injection throughout, and most DI Containers (even Unity, but not <a href="http://mef.codeplex.com/">MEF</a>) natively understands that pattern. Consequently, this means that we can mostly just map interfaces to concrete types and the container will figure out the rest for us.
    </p>
    <p>
        Notice that I'm using the <a href="http://kozmic.pl/archive/2010/06/20/how-i-use-inversion-of-control-containers.aspx">Configure-Resolve-Release pattern</a> described by <a href="http://kozmic.pl">Krzysztof Koźmic</a>. First I configure the container, then I resolve<em> the entire object graph</em>, and lastly I dispose the container.
    </p>
    <p>
        The main part of the application's execution time will be spent within the Execute method, which is where all the real application code runs.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this example I wire up a console application, but it just as well might be any other type of application. In a web application we just do a resolve per web request instead.
    </p>
    <p>
        But wait! does that mean that we have to resolve the <em>entire</em> object graph of the application, even if we have dependencies that cannot be resolved at run-time? No, but that does not mean that you should pull from the container. <a href="http://kozmic.pl/archive/2010/06/22/how-i-use-inversion-of-control-containers-ndash-pulling-from.aspx">Pull from an Abstract Factory instead</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another question that is likely to arise is: <em>what if I have dependencies that I rarely use? Must I wire these prematurely, even if they are expensive?</em> No, <a href="/2010/01/20/RebuttalConstructorover-injectionanti-pattern">you don't have to do that either</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        In conclusion: there is never any reason to query the container. Use a container to compose your object graph, but don't rely on it by querying from it. Constructor Injection all the way enables most containers to auto-wire your application, and an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_factory_pattern">Abstract Factory</a> can be a dependency too.

        <div class="comment-content">Yes, MEF supports it, but I chose my words pretty carefully. Any container that needs a special attribute to handle Constructor Injection can hardly be said to <em>understand</em> the pattern. I can't point MEF to a class that uses Constructor Injection and expect it to natively recognize it as such. MEF understands the [ImportingConstructor] attribute, but that's a different thing altogether.</div>

        <div class="comment-content">I have to agree with Mark.<br>
        <br>
        Having special constructors all over the code makes MEF kind of lame in comparison to .NET NInject or Java's CDI.<br>
        I am sure it works just fine, but seems a bit too &quot;Hand's on&quot; when there are a few good options that require less customization on host containers.</div>
