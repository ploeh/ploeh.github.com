	<p>
		In my <a href="/2013/08/23/how-to-create-a-pure-f-aspnet-web-api-project">previous post</a>, I explained how to create an <a href="http://www.asp.net/web-api">ASP.NET Web API</a> project entirely in F#, without relying on a C# or VB host project. At the end of that article, I had a service which can be launched from Visual Studio 2012 and run in IIS Express, but it didn't run in <a href="http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/services/web-sites">Azure Web Sites</a>. In this post, I'll explain how to make this possible.

	</h3>
	<p>
		The first problem to solve is how to even deploy the Web Project to Azure in the first place. Because the project is a 'real' Visual Studio Web Project, it's possible to right-click on the project and select "Publish..." This brings up the dialog for publishing a Web Project to Azure, so that seems promising.
	</p>
	<p>
		However, actually attempting to do so soon produces this error message:
		<blockquote>Exception in executing publishing : The method or operation is not implemented.</blockquote>
		Apparently, someone in Microsoft chose to violate the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle">Liskov Substitution Principle</a>...
	</p>
	<p>
		Another, and, as it turns out, ultimately more productive, deployment options is to deploy via Git. Fortunately, I already kept a Git repository for the code, in order to make it easier for me to back out, if my experiments took me in wrong directions (which did happen a couple of times). Thus, I created the Web Site on the Azure portal, and configured it with a Git repository to which I can push.

		This should enable me to simply go
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>$ git push azure master</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		in order to deploy to my new Azure Web Site. Unfortunately, it didn't quite work:

		More work apparently remained.

		Import MSBuild projects <a href="#77aa53e2d32d49168b0481149ad0339f" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		As you can tell from the error message, the "target "pipelinePreDeployCopyAllFilesToOneFolder" does not exist in the project." Knowing that Visual Studio project files are actually MSBuild files with another extension, this sounds like an MSBuild issue. To figure out what to do, I opened a C# Web Project and began looking for various <code>Import</code> elements.
	</p>
	<p>
		After copying a couple of <code>Import</code> elements from a C# Web Project, and a bit of experimentation, I ended up with this in my .fsproj file:
	</p>
	<p>
<pre style="margin: 0px;"><span style="color: blue;">&lt;</span><span style="color: #a31515;">Import</span><span style="color: blue;"> </span><span style="color: red;">Project</span><span style="color: blue;">=</span>"<span style="color: blue;">$(VSToolsPath)\WebApplications\Microsoft.WebApplication.targets</span>"<span style="color: blue;"> </span>
        <span style="color: red;">Condition</span><span style="color: blue;">=</span>"<span style="color: blue;">'$(VSToolsPath)' != ''</span>"<span style="color: blue;"> /&gt;</span>
<span style="color: blue;">&lt;</span><span style="color: #a31515;">Import</span><span style="color: blue;"> </span><span style="color: red;">Project</span><span style="color: blue;">=</span>"<span style="color: blue;">$(MSBuildExtensionsPath32)\Microsoft\VisualStudio\v11.0\WebApplications\Microsoft.WebApplication.targets</span>"<span style="color: blue;"> </span>
        <span style="color: red;">Condition</span><span style="color: blue;">=</span>"<span style="color: blue;">true</span>"<span style="color: blue;"> /&gt;</span></pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		My .fsproj file already had an existing <code>Import</code> element, so I added these two just below the existing element. I haven't experimented with removing one of these elements, so it may be possible to simplify this, or somehow make it more robust. What mattered to me was that this enabled me to move on:

		Alas, while deployment succeeded, I wasn't out of the woods yet.

	<p>
		Browsing to the (successfully deployed) site gave me this (rather disappointing) message:
		<blockquote>You do not have permission to view this directory or page.</blockquote>
	</p>
	<p>
		After digging around for a while, I discovered that neither Global.asax nor web.config were deployed to the actual site. The way to resolve that is to change the <em>Build Action</em> for these files to <em>Content</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
		This was the last hurdle. Pushing those changes to the remote Git repository updated the API, which now works! For the time being, you can see it running <a href="http://febapi.azurewebsites.net">here</a>, although I will not promise to keep it around forever.
