	<p>
		This article is an instalment in <a href="/2022/03/28/monads">an article series about monads</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		There's a bit of groundwork which will be useful before we get to the <a href="/2022/04/11/monad-laws">monad laws</a>. There are two ways to present the monad laws. One is quite unintuitive, but uses only the concepts already discussed in the <a href="/2022/03/28/monads">introductory article</a>. The other way to present the laws is much more intuitive, but builds on a derived concept: Kleisli composition.
	</p>
	<p>
		I find it preferable to take the intuitive route, even if it requires this little detour around the <a href="https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/12/23/kleisli-categories/">Kleisli category</a>.

		Monadic functions <a href="#751e600750344be6bce3b19a3353ac9b" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		Imagine some monad - any monad. It could be <em>Maybe</em> (AKA <em>Option</em>), <em>Either</em> (AKA <em>Result</em>), <em>Task</em>, <em>State</em>, etcetera. In <a href="https://www.haskell.org">Haskell</a> notation we denote it <code>m</code>. (Don't worry if you don't know Haskell. The type notation is fairly intuitive, and I'll explain enough of it along the way.)
	</p>
	<p>
		You may have a function that takes some input and returns a monadic value. Perhaps it's a parser that takes a string as input and returns a <em>Maybe</em> or <em>Either</em> as output:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>String -&gt; Maybe Int</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		Perhaps it's a database query that takes an ID as input and returns a <em>Task</em> or <em>IO</em> value:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>UUID -&gt; IO Reservation</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		Notice that in Haskell, you write the input to the left of the output. (This is also the case in <a href="https://fsharp.org/">F#</a>.) Functions looks like arrows that point from the input to the output, which is a common depiction that <a href="/2021/11/22/functions-as-pipes">I've also used before</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		If we generalise this notation, we would write a monadic function like this:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>a -&gt; m b</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		<code>a</code> is a generic type that denotes input. It could be <code>String</code> or <code>UUID</code> as shown above, or anything else. Likewise, <code>b</code> is another generic type that could be <code>Int</code>, <code>Reservation</code>, or anything else. And <code>m</code>, as already explained, may be any monad. The corresponding C# method signature would be:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>Func&lt;T,&nbsp;Monad&lt;T1&gt;&gt;</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		In C#, it's <a href="/2015/08/03/idiomatic-or-idiosyncratic">idiomatic</a> to name generic type arguments <code>T</code> and <code>T1</code> rather than <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>, but the idea is the same.
	</p>
	<p>
		The previous article used <code>Functor&lt;T&gt;</code> as a stand-in for any functor. Likewise, now that you know what a monad is, the type <code>Monad&lt;T&gt;</code> is a similar pretend type. It symbolises 'any monad'.
	</p>

	<p>
		In <a href="/2021/11/22/functions-as-pipes">Functions as pipes</a> you got a visual illustration of how functions compose. If you have a function that returns a Boolean value, you can use that Boolean value as input to a function that accepts Boolean values as input. Generalised, if one function returns <code>a</code> and another function accepts <code>a</code> as input, you can compose these two functions:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>(a -&gt; b) -&gt; (b -&gt; c) -&gt; (a -&gt; c)</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		A combinator of this type takes two functions as input: <code>a -&gt; b</code> (a function from <code>a</code> to <code>b</code>) and <code>(b -&gt; c)</code>, and returns a new function that 'hides' the middle step: <code>a -&gt; c</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		If this is possible, it seems intuitive that you can also compose monadic functions:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>(&gt;=&gt;) :: Monad m =&gt; (a -&gt; m b) -&gt; (b -&gt; m c) -&gt; a -&gt; m c</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		The <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base/docs/Control-Monad.html#v:-62--61--62-">&gt;=&gt;</a> operator is known as the <em>fish</em> operator - or more precisely the <em>right fish</em> operator, since there's also a <em>left fish</em> operator <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base/docs/Control-Monad.html#v:-60--61--60-">&lt;=&lt;</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		This is known as <em>Kleisli composition</em>. In C# you could write it like this:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">static</span>&nbsp;Func&lt;T,&nbsp;Monad&lt;T2&gt;&gt;&nbsp;<span style="color:#74531f;">Compose</span>&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af;">T</span>,&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">T1</span>,&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">T2</span>&gt;(
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">this</span>&nbsp;Func&lt;T,&nbsp;Monad&lt;T1&gt;&gt;&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">action1</span>,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Func&lt;T1,&nbsp;Monad&lt;T2&gt;&gt;&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">action2</span>)
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#8f08c4;">return</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">x</span>&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;action1(x).SelectMany(action2);
}</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		Notice that Kleisli composition works for any monad. You don't need any new abilities in order to compose a monad in this way. The composition exclusively relies on <code>SelectMany</code> (monadic <em>bind</em>).
	</p>
	<p>
		Here's a usage example:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>Func&lt;<span style="color:blue;">string</span>,&nbsp;Monad&lt;<span style="color:blue;">int</span>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">f</span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">s</span>&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;Monad.Return(s.Length);
Func&lt;<span style="color:blue;">int</span>,&nbsp;Monad&lt;<span style="color:blue;">bool</span>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">g</span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">i</span>&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;Monad.Return(i&nbsp;%&nbsp;2&nbsp;==&nbsp;0);
 
Func&lt;<span style="color:blue;">string</span>,&nbsp;Monad&lt;<span style="color:blue;">bool</span>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">composed</span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;f.Compose(g);</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		The <code>Compose</code> method corresponds to the right fish operator, but obviously you could define an overload that flips the arguments. That would correspond to the left fish operator.

	<p>
		Kleisli composition seems compelling, but in reality I find that I rarely use it. If it isn't that useful, then why dedicate an entire article to it?
	</p>
	<p>
		As I wrote in the introduction, it's mostly because it gives us an intuitive way to describe the monad laws.
	</p>
	<p>
		Kleisli arrows form a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory">category</a>. As such, it's a universal abstraction. I admit that <a href="/2017/10/04/from-design-patterns-to-category-theory">this article series</a> has strayed away from its initial vision of discussing category theory, but I still find it assuring when I encounter some bedrock of theory behind a programming concept.

		Conclusion <a href="#afc020e8bbe7436b891782b8d469c111" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		Kleisli composition lets you compose two (or more) compatible monadic functions into a single monadic function.
