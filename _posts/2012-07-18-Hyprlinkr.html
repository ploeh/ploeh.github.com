	<p>This post serves as an announcement that my latest open source project <a href="https://github.com/ploeh/Hyprlinkr">Hyprlinkr</a> is available. It's a very sharply focused helper library for the <a href="http://www.asp.net/web-api">ASP.NET Web API</a>, enabling you to create type-safe hyperlinks between resources in a RESTful API.</p> <p>It's basically a reusable package of <a href="/2012/04/17/HyperlinkingWithTheASPNETWebAPI.aspx">the RouteLinker class I previously presented as a spike</a>. The <a href="http://joseoncode.com/2011/03/18/wcf-web-api-strongly-typed-resource-linker/">original idea</a> wasn't mine, but <a href="http://joseoncode.com/">José F. Romaniello's</a> - I just took the idea and created a project out of it.</p> <p>The library is mostly useful if you build <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html">level 3</a> RESTful APIs with the ASP.NET Web API.</p> <p>It's available <a href="https://nuget.org/packages/Hyprlinkr">as a NuGet package</a>.</p> <p>Apart from that, I'll refer you to <a href="https://github.com/ploeh/Hyprlinkr">the project site</a> for more information.</p>

	<div class="comment-content">Thanks for this Mark, it will surely come in use<br>
<br>
The one thing I am struggling to reconcile, you must have some insight on, is the addition of the link properties to the model. <br>
<br>
I am thinking that hyperlinks should be a responsibility of the serializer and not the model...</div>

	<div class="comment-content">In the cases I can think about right now, I'd say that the Controller (or one of its dependencies) must have the responsibility of adding the hyperlinks. It's an application concern to define what can be linked to. This isn't any different than adding &quot;&lt;a href&quot; links to HTML in a 'normal' web application.</div>

	<div class="comment-content">thanks for mentioning my article, I really like what you did.<br>
<br>
At the time I wrote that article i was trying different syntax to create a DSL to express a workflow, like the coffee workflow in  &quot;Rest on practice&quot;.<br>
<br>
i think this is an step forward<br>
<br>
thanks</div>
