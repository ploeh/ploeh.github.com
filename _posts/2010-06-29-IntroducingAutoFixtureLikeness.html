title: "Introducing AutoFixture Likeness"

{% include JB/setup %}

<div id="post">
	<p>The <a href="/2010/04/06/MappingtypeswithAutoFixture">last time I presented a sample</a> of an <a href="http://autofixture.codeplex.com/">AutoFixture</a>-based unit test, I purposely glossed over the state-based verification that asserted that the resulting state of the <em>basket</em> variable was that the appropriate Pizza was added:</p>
	<p>
		<pre style="margin: 0px"><span style="color: #2b91af">Assert</span>.IsTrue(basket.Pizze.Any(p =&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; p.Name == pizza.Name), <span style="color: #a31515">"Basket has added pizza."</span>);</pre>
</p>
<p>The main issue with this assertion is that the implied equality expression is rather weak: we consider a PizzaPresenter instance to be equal to a Pizza instance if their Name properties match.</p>
<p>What if they have other properties (like Size) that don't match? If this is the case, the test would be a <a href="http://xunitpatterns.com/false%20negative.html">false negative</a>. A match would be found in the Pizze collection, but the instances would not truly represent the same pizza.</p>
<p>How do we resolve this conundrum without introducing <a href="http://xunitpatterns.com/Test%20Logic%20in%20Production.html#Equality%20Pollution">equality pollution</a>? AutoFixture offers one option in the form of the generic Likeness&lt;TSource, TDestination&gt; class. This class offers convention-based <a href="http://xunitpatterns.com/test-specific%20equality.html">test-specific equality</a> mapping from TSource to TDestination and overriding the Equals method.</p>
<p>One of the ways we can use it is by a convenience extension method. This unit test is a refactoring of the test from the previous post, but now using Likeness:</p>
<p>
	<pre style="margin: 0px">[<span style="color: #2b91af">TestMethod</span>]
<span style="color: blue">public</span> <span style="color: blue">void</span> AddWillAddToBasket_Likeness()
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: green">// Fixture setup</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue">var</span> fixture = <span style="color: blue">new</span> <span style="color: #2b91af">Fixture</span>();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fixture.Register&lt;<span style="color: #2b91af">IPizzaMap</span>, <span style="color: #2b91af">PizzaMap</span>&gt;();
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue">var</span> basket = fixture.Freeze&lt;<span style="color: #2b91af">Basket</span>&gt;();
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue">var</span> pizza = fixture.CreateAnonymous&lt;<span style="color: #2b91af">PizzaPresenter</span>&gt;();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue">var</span> expectedPizza = 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pizza.AsSource().OfLikeness&lt;<span style="color: #2b91af">Pizza</span>&gt;();
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue">var</span> sut = fixture.CreateAnonymous&lt;<span style="color: #2b91af">BasketPresenter</span>&gt;();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: green">// Exercise system</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sut.Add(pizza);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: green">// Verify outcome</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: #2b91af">Assert</span>.IsTrue(basket.Pizze.Any(expectedPizza.Equals));
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: green">// Teardown</span>
}</pre>
</p>
<p>Notice how the Likeness instance is created with the AsSource() extension method. The <em>pizza</em> instance (of type PizzaPresenter) is the source of the Likeness, whereas the Pizza domain model type is the destination. The <em>expectedPizza</em> instance is of type Likeness&lt;PizzaPresenter, Pizza&gt;.</p>
<p>The Likeness class overrides Equals with a convention-based comparison: if two properties have the same name and type, they are equal if their values are equal. All public properties on the destination must have equal properties on the source.</p>
<p>This allows me to specify the Equals method as the predicate for the Any method in the assertion:</p>
<p>
	<pre style="margin: 0px"><span style="color: #2b91af">Assert</span>.IsTrue(basket.Pizze.Any(expectedPizza.Equals));</pre>
</p>
<p>When the Any method evalues the Pizze collection, it executes the Equals method on Likeness, resulting in a convention-based comparison of all public properties and fields on the two instances.</p>
<p>It's possible to customize the comparison to override the behavior for certain properties, but I will leave that to later posts. This post only scratches the surface of what Likeness can do.</p>
<p>To use Likeness, you must add a reference to the Ploeh.SemanticComparison assembly. You can create a new instance using the public constructor, but to use the AsSource extension method, you will need to add a using directive:</p>
<p>
	<pre style="margin: 0px"><span style="color: blue">using</span> Ploeh.SemanticComparison.Fluent;</pre>
</p>

	        Hi Mark,<br/>
	        <p>
	            In your example, you are only comparing one property and I know that you can test many properties as well. 
	        </p>
	        <p>
	            Now it is my understanding that given many properties if <em>any</em> property doesn't match, then you'll get a test failure. My question is how to output a message pinpointing which property is causing the test to fail.

	            On another note, maybe you could ask Adam Ralph how he's integrated the comment section on his blog, which I believe is using the same platform as you are.

	        	David, if you want to get more detailed feedback on which properties don't match, you can use <code>expected.ShouldEqual(actual);</code>
