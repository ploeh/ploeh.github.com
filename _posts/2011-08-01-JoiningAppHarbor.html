title: "Joining AppHarbor"

<div id="post">
	<p>I'm pleased to announce that I'll be joining <a href="http://appharbor.com">AppHarbor</a> as a developer. With my long-standing interest in TDD and OOD as well as my more recent interests in open-source .NET software, distributed source control systems, Continuous Delivery etc. AppHarbor seems like a perfect match for me.</p> <p>Although AppHarbor is very attractive to me, this has been a difficult decision as <a href="http://www.commentor.dk/">Commentor</a> has been a great employer. However, despite great customers I just don't feel like consulting at the moment. Since Safewhere went out of business I've been writing much less code than I'd liked, so when presented with an opportunity to join such a congenial outfit as AppHarbor I had few doubts.</p> <p>I'll still be working out of Copenhagen, Denmark, and I also expect to keep up my usual community engagement at home as well as abroad.</p>
