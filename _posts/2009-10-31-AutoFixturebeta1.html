	<p>
		<a href="http://autofixture.codeplex.com/">AutoFixture</a> beta 1 is now available on the CodePlex site! We have been using AutoFixture quite intensively in <a href="http://www.safewhere.net">Safewhere</a> for almost half a year now, and the core of it has turned out to be stable and much more powerful than I originally imagined.
	</p>
	<p>
		During that period, I have discovered and fixed a few bugs, but the most positive experience has been how extended usage has inspired us to come up with numerous ideas to new cool features. Some of these features are already implemented in the current release, and the rest are <a href="http://autofixture.codeplex.com/WorkItem/List.aspx">listed on the AutoFixture site</a>.

		The <a href="http://autofixture.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=29097">beta 1 release page</a> has more details about this particular release.
