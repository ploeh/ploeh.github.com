	<p>
		At May 12 2009 I'll be speaking at 7N's <em>IT Konference 2009</em> (in Danish, so that's no spelling error). You can read the program <a href="http://www.7n.com/dk/Downloads/test2009.pdf">here</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The topic of my talk will be TDD patterns and terminology, so I'll discuss Fixtures, Stubs, Mocks and the like. As always, <a href="http://xunitpatterns.com/">xUnit Test Patterns</a> will form the basis of my vocabulary.
	</p>
	<p>
		Of the other speakers, I'm particularly looking forward to hear my good friend Martin Gildenpfennig from <a href="http://community.ative.dk/blogs/">Ative</a> speak!
