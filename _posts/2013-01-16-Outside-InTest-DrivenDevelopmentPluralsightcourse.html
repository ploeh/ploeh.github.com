<br>
It is a very good course although some of the latter modules were a bit too quick for me. It must be due to my lack of experience. <br>
<br>
On another separate note, I know that you are going to be giving a course on Dependency injection in London with SkillsMatters. Will it be covering the material in Outside in TDD? Would it be possible for you to provide more details that what's on the site?<br>
<br>
TIA,<br>
<br>

	<div class="comment-content">Currently I don't have more information about the Skills Matter course than what's on their web site, but as it's a course about Dependency Injection, it's not going to cover TDD in particular. That's a different subject.</div>
