		A book needs a cover, but how do you choose a cover illustration for a programming book? Software development tends to be abstract, so how to pick a compelling picture?
	</p>
	<p>
		Occasionally, a book manages to do everything right, such as the wonderful <a href="https://amzn.to/3fEB938">Mazes for Programmers</a>, which also happens to have a cover appropriate for its contents. Most publishers, however, resort to pictures of bridges, outer space, animals, or folk costumes.
	</p>
	<p>
		For <a href="/code-that-fits-in-your-head">my new book</a>, I wanted a cover that, like <em>Mazes for Programmers</em>, relates to its contents. Fortunately, the book contains a few concepts that easily visualise, including a concept I call <em>fractal architecture</em>. You can create some compelling drawings based on <em>hex flowers</em> nested within the petals of other hex flowers. I chose to render some of those for the book cover:

	<p>
		I used <a href="https://observablehq.com">Observable</a> to host the code that renders the fractal hex flowers. This enabled me to experiment with various colour schemes and effects. Here's one example:

	</p>
	<p>
		Not only did I write the program to render the figures on Observable, I turned the notebook into <a href="https://observablehq.com/@ploeh/fractal-hex-flowers">a comprehensive article</a> explaining not only how to draw the figures, but also the geometry behind it.

		The present blog post is really only meant as a placeholder. The real article is over at Observable. <a href="https://observablehq.com/@ploeh/fractal-hex-flowers">Go there to read it</a>.
