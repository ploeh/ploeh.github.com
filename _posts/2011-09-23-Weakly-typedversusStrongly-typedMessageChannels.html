title: "Weakly-typed versus Strongly-typed Message Channels"

<div id="post">
	<p>Soon after I posted my previous blog post on <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2011/09/19/MessageDispatchingWithoutServiceLocation.aspx">message dispatching without Service Location</a> I received an email from Jeff Saunders with some great observations. Jeff has been so kind to allow me to quote his email here on the blog, so here it is:</p> <blockquote> <p>“I enjoyed your latest blog post about message dispatching. I have to ask, though: why do we want weakly-typed messages? Why can't we just inject an appropriate IConsumer&lt;T&gt; into our services - they know which messages they're going to send or receive.</p> <p>“A really good example of this is ISubject&lt;T&gt; from Rx. It implements both IObserver&lt;T&gt; (a message consumer) and IObservable&lt;T&gt; (a message producer) and the default implementation Subject&lt;T&gt; routes messages directly from its IObserver side to its IObservable side. </p> <p>“We can use this with DI quite nicely - I have written an example in .NET Pad: <a href="http://dotnetpad.net/ViewPaste/woTkGk6_GEq3P9xTVEJYZg#c9,c26,">http://dotnetpad.net/ViewPaste/woTkGk6_GEq3P9xTVEJYZg#c9,c26,</a></p> <p>“The good thing about this is that we now have access to all of the standard LINQ query operators and the new ones added in Rx, so we can use a select query to map messages between layers, for instance.</p> <p>“This way we get all the benefits of a weakly-typed IChannel interface, with the added advantages of strong typing for our messages and composability using Rx.</p> <p>“One potential benefit of weak typing that could be raised is that we can have just a single implementation for IChannel, instead of an ISubject&lt;T&gt; for each message type. I don't think this is really a benefit, though, as we may want different propagation behaviour for each message type - there are other implementations of ISubject&lt;T&gt; that call consumers asynchronously, and we could pass any IObservable&lt;T&gt; or IObserver&lt;T&gt; into a service for testing purposes.”</p></blockquote> <p>These are great observations and I think that Rx holds much promise in this space. Basically you can say that in <a href="http://abdullin.com/cqrs">CQRS</a>-style architectures we're already pushing events (and commands) around, so why not build upon what the framework offers?</p> <p>Even if you find the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd783449.aspx">IObserver&lt;T&gt;</a> interface a bit too clunky with its <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd782792.aspx">OnNext</a>, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd781657.aspx">OnError</a> and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd782982.aspx">OnCompleted</a> methods compared to the strongly typed IConsumer&lt;T&gt; interface, the question still remains: why do we want weakly-typed messages?</p> <p>We don't, necessarily. My previous post wasn't meant as a particular endorsement of a weakly typed messaging channel. It was more an observation that I've seen many variations of this IChannel interface:</p> <div style="font-family: ; background: white; color: "><pre style="margin: 0px"><span style="color: "><font color="#0000ff"><font style="font-size: 10pt">public</font></font></span><font style="font-size: 10pt"> <span style="color: "><font color="#0000ff">interface</font></span> </font><span style="color: "><font style="font-size: 10pt" color="#2b91af">IChannel</font></span></pre><pre style="margin: 0px"><font style="font-size: 10pt">{</font></pre><pre style="margin: 0px"><font style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: "><font color="#0000ff">void</font></span> Send&lt;T&gt;(T message);</font></pre><pre style="margin: 0px"><font style="font-size: 10pt">}</font></pre></div>
<p>The most important thing I wanted to point out was that while the generic type argument may create the illusion that this is a strongly typed method, this is all it is: an illusion. IChannel isn't strongly typed because you can invoke the Send method with <em>any</em> type of message  -  and the code will still compile. This is no different than the <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2010/11/01/PatternRecognitionAbstractFactoryOrServiceLocator.aspx">mechanical distinction between a Service Locator and an Abstract Factory</a>.</p>
<p>Thus, when defining a channel interface I normally prefer to make this explicit and instead model it like this:</p>
<div style="font-family: ; background: white; color: "><pre style="margin: 0px"><span style="color: "><font color="#0000ff"><font style="font-size: 10pt">public</font></font></span><font style="font-size: 10pt"> <span style="color: "><font color="#0000ff">interface</font></span> </font><span style="color: "><font style="font-size: 10pt" color="#2b91af">IChannel</font></span></pre><pre style="margin: 0px"><font style="font-size: 10pt">{</font></pre><pre style="margin: 0px"><font style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: "><font color="#0000ff">void</font></span> Send(<span style="color: "><font color="#0000ff">object</font></span> message);</font></pre><pre style="margin: 0px"><font style="font-size: 10pt">}</font></pre></div>
<p>This achieves exactly the same and is more honest.</p>
<p>Still, this doesn't really answer Jeff's question: is this preferable to one or more strongly typed IConsumer&lt;T&gt; dependencies?</p>
<p>Any high-level application entry point that relies on a weakly typed IChannel can get by with a single IChannel dependency. This is flexible, but (just like with <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2010/02/03/ServiceLocatorIsAnAntiPattern.aspx">Service Locator</a>), it might hide that the client may have (or (d)evolve) too many responsibilities.</p>
<p>If, instead, the client would rely on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2420193/dependency-injection-constructor-madness/2420245#2420245">strongly typed dependencies it becomes much easier to see</a> if/when it violates the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle">Single Responsibility Principle</a>.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I'd tend to prefer strongly typed <a href="http://www.eaipatterns.com/DatatypeChannel.html">Datatype Channels</a> instead of a single weakly typed channel, but one shouldn't underestimate the flexibility of a general-purpose channel either.</p>
