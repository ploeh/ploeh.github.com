	<p>
		<a href="http://autofixture.codeplex.com/">AutoFixture</a> now includes a <a href="http://ayende.com/projects/rhino-mocks.aspx">Rhino Mocks</a>-based auto-mocking feature similar to the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/moq/">Moq</a>-based auto-mocking customization <a href="/2010/08/19/AutoFixtureasanauto-mockingcontainer">previously described</a>.

		The developer of this great optional feature, the talented but discreet Mikkel has this to say:
	</p>
	<p>
		"The auto-mocking capabilities of AutoFixture now include auto-mocking using Rhino Mocks, completely along the same lines as the existing Moq-extension. Although it will not be a part of the .zip-distribution before the next official release, it can be built from the latest source code (November 13, 2010) which contains the relevant VS2008 solution: AutoRhinoMock.sln. It is built on Rhino.Mocks version 3.6.0.0. To use it, add a reference to Ploeh.AutoFixture.AutoRhinoMock.dll and customize the Fixture instance with:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre style="margin: 0px"><span><font color="#0000ff"><font style="font-size: 10pt">var</font></font></span><font style="font-size: 10pt"> fixture = <span><font color="#0000ff">new</font></span> <span><font color="#2b91af">Fixture</font></span>()</font>
<font style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Customize(<span><font color="#0000ff">new</font></span> <span><font color="#2b91af">AutoRhinoMockCustomization</font></span>());</font></pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		"which automatically will result in mocked instances of requests for interfaces and abstract classes."
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm really happy to see the AutoFixture eco-system grow in this way, as it both demonstrates how AutoFixture gives you great flexibility and enables you to work with the tools you prefer.
