	<p>
		It was only earlier this week that I released <a href="http://autofixture.codeplex.com/">AutoFixture</a> .8.2, but now I'm releasing version .8.3  -  not that there was anything wrong with .8.2 (that I know of), but I had some time to implement new features, and I wanted to properly release those.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the future I will blog about these new features (along with all the other AutoFixture features I haven't introduced yet).

		Get it at the <a href="http://autofixture.codeplex.com/">AutoFixture CodePlex site</a> as usual.
