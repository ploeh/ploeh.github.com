	</p>
	<p>
		This post is the first in <a href="/2013/09/06/dependency-injection-and-events">a series of articles about Dependency Injection and events</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Imagine that you have an interface that defines an event:
	</p>
	<p>
<pre style="margin: 0px;"><span style="color: blue;">public</span> <span style="color: blue;">interface</span> <span style="color: #2b91af;">IDependency</span>
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue;">event</span> <span style="color: #2b91af;">EventHandler</span> ItHappened;
}</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		In order to keep the example simple, the ItHappened event carries no information; it just raises an event with an <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.eventargs.aspx">EventArgs</a> instance. Thus, subscribers can react to the fact that this particular event happened, but there's no data contained in the event. However, the following discussion doesn't change if the event carries information.
	</p>
	<p>
		A class must react to the events raised by IDependency implementations. A common approach is to subscribe to the event in the constructor. We can call this pattern <em>Constructor Subscription</em>:
	</p>
	<p>
<pre style="margin: 0px;"><span style="color: blue;">public</span> <span style="color: blue;">class</span> <span style="color: #2b91af;">NeedyClass</span>
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue;">private</span> <span style="color: blue;">readonly</span> <span style="color: #2b91af;">IDependency</span> dependency;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue;">public</span> NeedyClass(<span style="color: #2b91af;">IDependency</span> dependency)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue;">if</span> (dependency == <span style="color: blue;">null</span>)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue;">throw</span> <span style="color: blue;">new</span> <span style="color: #2b91af;">ArgumentNullException</span>(<span style="color: #a31515;">"dependency"</span>);
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue;">this</span>.dependency = dependency;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue;">this</span>.dependency.ItHappened += <span style="color: blue;">this</span>.OnItHappened;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue;">private</span> <span style="color: blue;">void</span> OnItHappened(<span style="color: blue;">object</span> sender, <span style="color: #2b91af;">EventArgs</span> e)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: green;">// Handle event here</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
}</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		The concern is that, by subscribing to an event, the constructor violates <a href="https://vuscode.wordpress.com/">Nikola Malovic</a>'s <a href="https://vuscode.wordpress.com/2009/10/16/inversion-of-control-single-responsibility-principle-and-nikola-s-laws-of-dependency-injection">4th law of IoC</a>: <a href="/2011/03/03/InjectionConstructorsshouldbesimple">Injection Constructors should perform no work</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		This rule about Dependency Injection explains why you can <a href="/2011/03/04/Composeobjectgraphswithconfidence">compose big object graphs with confidence</a>. Still, the most compelling reason for conforming strictly to the rule is most likely performance considerations. So, what if you subscribe to a single event or two during construction? Will it adversely (and noticeably) affect performance of your overall system?
	</p>
	<p>
		As always, the answer to such questions is: <em>measure</em>. However, I'd be quite surprised if it turns out that a single event subscription has a <em>huge</em> impact on performance...

	</h3>
	<p>
		Consider the implementation of NeedyClass: it contains a design smell. Can you spot it?
	</p>
	<p>
		Given the definition of the IDependency interface, the ItHappened event is the only member defined by the interface. If this is the case, then why is NeedyClass holding on to a reference of the interface?
	</p>
	<p>
		You can remove the <code>dependency</code> field from NeedyClass, and nothing is going to break:
	</p>
	<p>
<pre style="margin: 0px;"><span style="color: blue;">public</span> <span style="color: blue;">class</span> <span style="color: #2b91af;">NeedyClass</span>
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue;">public</span> NeedyClass(<span style="color: #2b91af;">IDependency</span> dependency)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue;">if</span> (dependency == <span style="color: blue;">null</span>)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue;">throw</span> <span style="color: blue;">new</span> <span style="color: #2b91af;">ArgumentNullException</span>(<span style="color: #a31515;">"dependency"</span>);
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dependency.ItHappened += <span style="color: blue;">this</span>.OnItHappened;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue;">private</span> <span style="color: blue;">void</span> OnItHappened(<span style="color: blue;">object</span> sender, <span style="color: #2b91af;">EventArgs</span> e)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: green;">// Handle event here</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
}</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		From the perspective of an outside observer, that's really strange. Why are we required to pass in an object that's not going to be used as is? Just like in a <a href="/2013/07/20/linq-versus-the-lsp">previous discussion about the implications of injecting IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</a>, if you're injecting an abstraction, and the constructor then starts querying, modifying, examining, or otherwise fidget with the injected object, then you're probably injecting the wrong object.
	</p>
	<p>
		Keep in mind that Constructor Injection is a declaration of requirements. It's the declaring class that advertises to the world: <em>these are (some of) my invariants</em>. If the class can't use the injected dependency as is, it suggests that it requested the wrong object from its clients. The class with the Injection Constructor should declare what it <em>really</em> needs. In this case, it needs to react to events.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the <a href="/2013/09/08/di-and-events-third-party-connect">next post, I'll show you a better (i.e. simpler) design</a> for reacting to events.

		Some readers <a href="https://twitter.com/GeertvanHorrik/status/375915573034909696">have commented</a> that NeedyClass <a href="https://twitter.com/clausndk/status/375931324436992000">must keep the reference to IDependency in order to unsubscribe from the event</a>. This is true, and something I overlooked when I originally banged together the sample code yesterday evening. Apparently, three unit tests were at least a test too few... :$
	</p>
	<p>
		From a perspective of basic correctness, NeedyClass works appropriately, but as <a href="https://twitter.com/GeertvanHorrik">Geert van Horrik</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/clausndk">Claus Nielsen</a> point out, this could easily lead to resource leaks (although in practice, that depends on the effective lifetime of NeedyClass).
	</p>
	<p>
		What happens when we start taking resource management into account?
	</p>
	<p>
		Well, NeedyClass must be sure to unsubscribe from the event when it goes out of scope. The most correct way of making sure this happens is to implement IDisposable:
	</p>
	<p>
<pre style="margin: 0px;"><span style="color: blue;">public</span> <span style="color: blue;">class</span> <span style="color: #2b91af;">NeedyClass</span> : <span style="color: #2b91af;">IDisposable</span>
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue;">private</span> <span style="color: blue;">readonly</span> <span style="color: #2b91af;">IDependency</span> dependency;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue;">public</span> NeedyClass(<span style="color: #2b91af;">IDependency</span> dependency)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue;">if</span> (dependency == <span style="color: blue;">null</span>)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue;">throw</span> <span style="color: blue;">new</span> <span style="color: #2b91af;">ArgumentNullException</span>(<span style="color: #a31515;">"dependency"</span>);
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue;">this</span>.dependency = dependency;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue;">this</span>.dependency.ItHappened += <span style="color: blue;">this</span>.OnItHappened;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue;">private</span> <span style="color: blue;">void</span> OnItHappened(<span style="color: blue;">object</span> sender, <span style="color: #2b91af;">EventArgs</span> e)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: green;">// Handle event here</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue;">public</span> <span style="color: blue;">void</span> Dispose()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue;">this</span>.dependency.ItHappened -= <span style="color: blue;">this</span>.OnItHappened;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
}</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		While this weakens the argument that NeedyClass is requesting the wrong kind of dependency, this is a lot of work just to consume an event. Furthermore, it isn't particularly safe, because you'll <em>have</em> to remember to dispose of all of your NeedyClass instances.
	</p>
	<p>
		Thus, <a href="/2013/09/08/di-and-events-third-party-connect">a better approach</a> is still warranted.

			Or if you want to be explicit about the dependencies, then go for something like <i>NeedyClass : IHandle&lt;ItHappened&gt;</i>. Nevertheless, 
			dependency on ItHappened within NeedyClass would still easily be found with static analysis. A few lines of CQLinq with NDepend.
