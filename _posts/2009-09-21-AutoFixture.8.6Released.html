<div id="post">
	<p>Yesterday I released version .8.6 of <a href="http://autofixture.codeplex.com/">AutoFixture</a>. It is a minor release that simply adds some new features.</p> <p>There are some minor breaking changes (documented on the <a href="http://autofixture.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=33256">release page</a>), but they only affect supporting classes and don't touch on any of the code examples I have so far published. In other words, if you are using AutoFixture's fluent interface, your code should still compile.</p> <p>Please go ahead and download it and use it. As always, comments and questions are welcome, either here or in the <a href="http://autofixture.codeplex.com/Thread/List.aspx">forum</a>.</p>
