	This is the eighth post in <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2013/02/06/StringCalculatorKataWithAutoFixture.aspx">a series of posts</a> about the <a href="http://osherove.com/tdd-kata-1/">String Calculator kata</a> done with <a href="https://github.com/AutoFixture/AutoFixture">AutoFixture</a>.
</p>
<p>
	This screencast implements the requirement of the kata's exercise 8 and 9. Although the kata has nine steps, it turned out that I slightly misinterpreted the requirements of exercise 8 and ended up implementing the requirements of exercise 9 as well as those of exercise 8 - or perhaps I was just gold plating.
