		In my <a href="{{ site.production_url }}/encapsulation-and-solid">Encapsulation and SOLID Pluralsight course</a>, I introduce <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command%E2%80%93query_separation">Command-Query Separation</a> (CQS) as a fundamental tool that will help you think about encapsulation. (I didn't come up with this myself, but rather picked it up from Bertrand Meyer's <a href="http://amzn.to/1claOin">Object-Oriented Software Construction</a>.)
	</p>
	<p>
		Despite the age of the CQS principle, it's still news to many people, and I get lots of questions about it; I attempt to <a href="/2014/08/11/cqs-versus-server-generated-ids">answer them as well as I can</a>. Most questions are about specific situations where the inquirer can't see a way out of issuing a Query and at the same time producing a side-effect.
	</p>
	<p>
		Perhaps the most common situation comes up when auditing comes into play. In some domains, auditing is a legal requirement. Asking any question must produce the side-effect that an audit record is created.
	</p>
	<p>
		How can you reconcile such requirements with CQS?

	<p>
		It may be helpful to first take a step back and attempt to answer the question: <em>what's a side-effect, anyway?</em>
	</p>
	<p>
		Perhaps we can learn from Functional Programming (gee, who'd have thunk!?), because Functional Programming is all about taming side-effects. Apparently, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Peyton_Jones">Simon Peyton-Jones</a> once said during an introduction to Haskell, that if your program has no side-effects, it cannot print a result, it cannot ask for input, it cannot interact with the network or the file system. All it does is heat up the CPU, after which someone from the audience interjected that heating up the CPU is also a side-effect, so, technically speaking, if you want your program to have no side-effects, you cannot even run it. (I only have this story on <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/a/293889/19115">second hand</a>, but it makes an important point.)
	</p>
	<p>
		Clearly, there's no such thing as a truly side-effect free program, so how do we define what a side-effect is?
	</p>
	<p>
		In strictly Functional languages, a side-effect occurs whenever a function isn't <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_transparency_(computer_science)">referentially transparent</a>. This fancy term means that you can replace a function call with its return value. If a function call isn't equivalent to its return value, it's either because the function call also has a side-effect, or because some side-effect caused the return value to change.
	</p>
	<p>
		This is closely related to the popular definition of a Query in CQS: <em>Asking the question mustn't change the answer.</em> This is, though, a weaker statement, because it allows a change in global state (e.g. another process updating a database record) to change the answer between two identical queries.
	</p>
	<p>
		In a completely different context, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">REST</a> it's often helpful to distinguish between <em>safe</em> and <em>idempotent</em> requests. The term <em>safe</em> is closely related to a side-effect free Query. As <a href="http://amzn.to/18aNOla">REST in Practice</a> states (p. 38): "By safe, we mean a GET request generates no server-side effects <em>for which the client can be held responsible</em>" (my emphasis). That can often be a useful distinction when thinking about CQS. A Query may cause a side-effect to happen (such as an audit record being written), but that side-effect doesn't concern the client.
	</p>
	<h3 id="d026ad59b17e4ea3a34646570678b771">
		Applications are never side-effect free <a href="#d026ad59b17e4ea3a34646570678b771" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		All of the above is useful because there's a large set of side-effects we can ignore in practice. We can ignore that the CPU heats up. We can ignore that web servers log HTTP requests. We can (probably) ignore that audit records are written. Such side-effects don't change the answer of a Query.
	</p>
	<p>
		There may still be cases where you need to deal explicitly with side-effects. You may wish to acknowledge to a user that a file was written. You may want to return a receipt to a client that your service received a document.
	</p>
	<p>
		It's important to realise that at the application level, applications are all about side-effects.
		<ul>
			<li>Applications may have GUIs; every time the application updates the screen, that's a side-effect.</li>
			<li>An application may be a REST service; it handles HTTP, which is modelled on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request%E2%80%93response">Request-Response pattern</a>. Even POST requests have responses. Everything in HTTP looks like Queries, because responses are return values.</li>
			<li>Applications may write to a database; clearly, side-effects are involved.</li>
		</ul>
		CQS, or referentially transparent functions, are principles we apply at the source code level to make the code easier to reason about and maintain. It's a question of separation of concerns: we separate pure computation from side-effects.
	</p>
	<p>
		Applications, on the other hand, are compositions of all relevant concerns. As I've previously described, <a href="/2011/05/31/AttheBoundaries,ApplicationsareNotObject-Oriented">at the boundaries, applications aren't Object-Oriented</a>. Neither are they Functional. All applications must have a boundary where Encapsulation, or FP, or CQS, doesn't apply. The trick is to keep that boundary as thin as possible.
	</p>
	<p>
		Thus, if you <em>must</em> violate CQS, do it in the boundary of the application. As an example, perhaps you're creating a REST service that enables clients to create new resources with POST requests. As a response, you want to return the address of the new resource. That violates CQS, but if you keep that violation at the entry point of the request, you've isolated the violation to the boundary of the application.
	</p>

	</h3>
	<p>
		It can be difficult to follow CQS, until you get your head around it, but it's always possible to apply it - except at the application boundary.
	</p>
	<p>
		How do we know that we can always apply CQS? We know this from Functional Programming. Strict Functional languages like <a href="https://www.haskell.org">Haskell</a> model <em>everything</em> as Queries (except at the boundaries), and Haskell is a Turing-complete language. If you can model everything as Queries, it should be clear that you can also separate Commands and Queries: if in doubt, eliminate the Command; FP shows how to do that.
	</p>
	<p>
		Even if you're working in an Object-Oriented language, learn some Functional Programming. It'll teach you how to apply CQS, which is a cornerstone of Encapsulation.

	<div class="comment-content">While I agree most part of this, I thought I would also point out that the CQS brings quite a bit of complications that doesn’t justify the benefit it brings.  Hence CQS in my opinion should not be the default reference architecture for the entire application.  If it has to be used, it must be with in a bounded context.
