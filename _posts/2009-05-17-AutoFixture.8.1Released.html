	<p>
		Today I've created a new release (.8.1 for lack of a better version number) of <a href="http://autofixture.codeplex.com/">AutoFixture</a>. While it contains some breaking changes, they all relate to features that I have yet to cover here on the blog  -  in other words: All the examples that I've posted so far are still valid.
