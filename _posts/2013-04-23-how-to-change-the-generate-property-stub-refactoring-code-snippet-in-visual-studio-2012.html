		This is mostly a quick note for my own benefit (since I just spent half an hour chasing this down), but I'm posting it here on the blog, in case someone else might find it useful. Here's how to change the code snippet for the "Generate Property Stub" smart tag in Visual Studio 2012:
	</p>
	<p>

	</p>
	<p>
		The template for this code is defined in
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 11.0\VC#\Snippets\1033
\Refactoring\GenerateProperty - Auto Property.snippet</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		You can open this file and hand-edit it, but contrary to previous versions of Visual Studio, it seems that you have to restart Visual Studio before the change takes effect.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you do this, be sure that you know what you're doing; you'd be mucking around with the internals of your Visual Studio installation.
