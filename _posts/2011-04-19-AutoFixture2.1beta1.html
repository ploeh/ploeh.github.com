	<p>It gives me great pleasure to announce that <a href="http://autofixture.codeplex.com/">AutoFixture</a> 2.1 beta 1 is now <a href="http://autofixture.codeplex.com/releases/view/64686">available for download</a>. Compared to version 2.0 this release mostly contains added features as well as a few bug fixes. The release page contains a list of the new features.</p> <p>The general availability of beta 1 of AutoFixture 2.1 marks the beginning of a trial period. If no new issues are reported within the next few weeks, a final version 2.1 will be released. If too many issues are reported, a new beta version may be necessary.</p> <p>Please <a href="http://autofixture.codeplex.com/workitem/list/basic">report any issues</a> you find.</p> <p>NuGet packages will follow the RTW version.</p>
