		You've probably noticed that it's easier to learn something new if it looks or sounds like something you already know. As a native Dane, I've found it easier to learn English and German than Russian and Japanese. If you originally were a Java or C# developer, you probably find <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> more approachable than <a href="https://clojure.org">Clojure</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language)">APL</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		I believe that this extends to <a href="/2017/10/04/from-design-patterns-to-category-theory">design patterns and universal abstractions</a> as well. If code new to you follows well-known abstractions, it may be easier to learn than if it's structured in an entirely ad-hoc manner. This is my motivation for learning such universal abstractions as <a href="/2017/10/06/monoids">monoids</a>, <a href="/2018/03/22/functors">functors</a>, and <a href="/2019/04/29/catamorphisms">catamorphisms</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		I particularly enjoy when it's possible to apply such abstractions to a proper problem. This occasionally happens. One example is my small article series on a <a href="/2019/08/26/functional-file-system">functional file system</a>.

	<p>
		In those articles, I described how you could base most of the code on the <a href="/2019/08/05/rose-tree-catamorphism">rose tree catamorphism</a>. There was just one snag. There was one function, <code>calculateMoves</code>, that I was unable to implement with the catamorphism. In the article, I acknowledged my failure:
		<blockquote>
			"Earlier, I wrote that you can implement desired <code>Tree</code> functionality with the <code>foldTree</code> function, but that was a simplification. If you can implement the functionality of <code>calculateMoves</code> with <code>foldTree</code>, I don't know how."
		</blockquote>
		This was true for both <a href="/2019/09/09/picture-archivist-in-haskell">the Haskell proof of concept</a> as well as <a href="/2019/09/16/picture-archivist-in-f">the F# port</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		<a href="https://about.me/tysonwilliams">Tyson Williams</a> and I <a href="/2019/09/16/picture-archivist-in-f#68b26807cc424856b8f762f214389826">discussed this wart</a> without getting closer to a solution.
	</p>
	<p>
		As the idiom goes, perfect is the enemy of good, so I decided to move on, although it nagged me.
	</p>

	</h3>
	<p>
		The problem with the <code>calculateMoves</code> function was that it needed to thread a 'context' recursively through the entire data structure. In this case, the context was a file path.
	</p>
	<p>
		When <code>calculateMoves</code> runs over the input tree, it needs to thread a relative <code>path</code> through the function, building it up as it traverses the data structure.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, if a leaf node named <code>1</code> is in a directory named <code>b</code>, which itself is a subdirectory of <code>a</code>, the relative path should be <code>a/b/1</code>. This example is straight from the test cases shown in both articles. You can also find the tests in the <a href="https://github.com/ploeh/picture-archivist">GitHub repository</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Each time <code>calculateMoves</code> visits a <code>Node</code> or <code>Leaf</code> it needs to know the parent <code>path</code> to calculate the destination path. As the articles show, this isn't too hard to do with regular pattern matching and recursion.
	</p>
	<p>
		I couldn't figure out, however, how to thread the <code>path</code> through the function when I tried to implement it with the catamorphism.

	<p>
		While I'm ready to walk away from problems when I'm stuck, I tend to remember them. Sometimes, I run into a solution much later.
	</p>
	<p>
		This happened to me yesterday. I was trying to answer <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/67037663/126014">a Stack Overflow question</a> which was explicitly about the application of universal abstractions. Once more, I was stuck by being unable to thread a 'context' through a catamorphism. This time, instead of a <code>path</code>, the context was an indentation depth. Basically, the question was how to render a tree with proper indentation.
	</p>
	<p>
		Again, this isn't hard if you resort to explicit pattern matching and recursion, but I couldn't figure out how to do it via the data structure's catamorphism.
	</p>
	<p>
		Fortunately, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/1364288/danidiaz">the user danidiaz</a> posted <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/67042881/126014">an awesome answer</a> while I was struggling. The answer uses a trick that I hadn't noticed before: It threads the indentation depth through the data structure by using the catamorphism to produce a structure map with <em>a function</em> as the carrier type. Specifically, danidiaz defines the algebra <code>Todo' (Int -&gt; String) -&gt; Int -&gt; String</code> to reduce a <code>Todo' (Int -&gt; String)</code> to an <code>Int -&gt; String</code> function. This function then gets initialised with the depth <code>0</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		While I've been doing functional programming for years, I sometimes still tend to forget that functions are first-class values...
	</p>
	<p>
		This trick, though, seems to be universally applicable. If you need to thread a context through a catamorphism, define the algebra to work on <em>functions</em> that take the context as an argument.
	</p>
	<p>
		If this is a universally applicable trick, it also ought to work with the <code>calculateMoves</code> function.

	</h3>
	<p>
		In my <a href="https://www.haskell.org">Haskell</a> proof of concept, the <code>calculateMoves</code> function originally looked like this:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:#2b91af;">calculateMoves</span>&nbsp;::&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">Tree</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">FilePath</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">FilePath</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">-&gt;</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">Tree</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">FilePath</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">Move</span>
calculateMoves&nbsp;=&nbsp;imp&nbsp;<span style="color:#a31515;">&quot;&quot;</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">where</span>&nbsp;imp&nbsp;path&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Leaf&nbsp;x)&nbsp;=&nbsp;Leaf&nbsp;$&nbsp;Move&nbsp;x&nbsp;$&nbsp;replaceDirectory&nbsp;x&nbsp;path
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;imp&nbsp;path&nbsp;(Node&nbsp;x&nbsp;xs)&nbsp;=&nbsp;Node&nbsp;(path&nbsp;&lt;/&gt;&nbsp;x)&nbsp;$&nbsp;imp&nbsp;(path&nbsp;&lt;/&gt;&nbsp;x)&nbsp;&lt;$&gt;&nbsp;xs</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		It uses an <code>imp</code> (for <em>implementation</em>) function to explicitly <a href="/2015/12/01/recurse">recurse</a> over a <code>Tree FilePath FilePath</code>. Until yesterday, I couldn't come up with a better solution to thread the <code>path</code> through the data structure.
	</p>
	<p>
		The new trick suggests that it'd be possible to implement the function on <code>foldTree</code> (the catamorphism) by using <em>a function</em> as the carrier type. Since the context to be threaded through the catamorphism is a <code>String</code> (the <code>path</code>), the catamorphism should produce a function that takes a <code>String</code> as argument. In other words, the carrier type of the <code>Tree</code> should be <code>String -&gt; Tree FilePath Move</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Let's expand on this: The type of <code>foldTree</code> is <code>foldTree :: (a -&gt; [c] -&gt; c) -&gt; (b -&gt; c) -&gt; Tree a b -&gt; c</code>. Usually, I tend to think of the type parameter <code>c</code> as the type of some value, but since it's unconstrained, it can also be <em>a function</em>. That's what we need here: <code>c</code> should be <code>String -&gt; Tree FilePath Move</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		That's not too hard to do, because of currying. Just write functions that take an extra <code>String</code> argument and pass them to <code>foldTree</code>:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:#2b91af;">calculateMoves</span>&nbsp;::&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">Tree</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">FilePath</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">FilePath</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">-&gt;</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">Tree</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">FilePath</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">Move</span>
calculateMoves&nbsp;t&nbsp;=&nbsp;foldTree&nbsp;fNode&nbsp;fLeaf&nbsp;t&nbsp;<span style="color:#a31515;">&quot;&quot;</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">where</span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">fNode</span>&nbsp;::&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">FilePath</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">-&gt;</span>&nbsp;[<span style="color:#2b91af;">String</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">-&gt;</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">Tree</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">FilePath</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">Move</span>]&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">-&gt;</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">String</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">-&gt;</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">Tree</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">FilePath</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">Move</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fNode&nbsp;x&nbsp;fs&nbsp;path&nbsp;=&nbsp;Node&nbsp;(path&nbsp;&lt;/&gt;&nbsp;x)&nbsp;$&nbsp;($&nbsp;path&nbsp;&lt;/&gt;&nbsp;x)&nbsp;&lt;$&gt;&nbsp;fs</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		Here I've used type annotations for the local functions, but that's entirely optional:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:#2b91af;">calculateMoves</span>&nbsp;::&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">Tree</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">FilePath</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">FilePath</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">-&gt;</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">Tree</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">FilePath</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">Move</span>
calculateMoves&nbsp;t&nbsp;=&nbsp;foldTree&nbsp;fNode&nbsp;fLeaf&nbsp;t&nbsp;<span style="color:#a31515;">&quot;&quot;</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">where</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fLeaf&nbsp;x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;path&nbsp;=&nbsp;Leaf&nbsp;$&nbsp;Move&nbsp;x&nbsp;$&nbsp;replaceDirectory&nbsp;x&nbsp;path
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fNode&nbsp;x&nbsp;fs&nbsp;path&nbsp;=&nbsp;Node&nbsp;(path&nbsp;&lt;/&gt;&nbsp;x)&nbsp;$&nbsp;($&nbsp;path&nbsp;&lt;/&gt;&nbsp;x)&nbsp;&lt;$&gt;&nbsp;fs</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		I included the type annotations to make it a little clearer what's going on. Recall that the type of <code>foldTree</code> is <code>foldTree :: (a -&gt; [c] -&gt; c) -&gt; (b -&gt; c) -&gt; Tree a b -&gt; c</code>. First consider the second of the two function arguments, the one I call <code>fLeaf</code> in the above code. It's the simplest of the two, so it makes sense to start with that one.
	</p>
	<p>
		The generic type of <code>fLeaf</code> is <code>b -&gt; c</code>. How does that map to the type of <code>fLeaf</code>, which is <code>FilePath -&gt; String -&gt; Tree FilePath Move</code>?
	</p>
	<p>
		Well, the <code>Tree</code> that the catamorphism runs on is a <code>Tree FilePath FilePath</code>. Mapped to the parametrically polymorphic type of <code>foldTree</code> that's <code>Tree a b</code>. In other words, <code>b</code> maps to <code>FilePath</code>. Thus, in order to fit the type of <code>b -&gt; c</code>, the type corresponding to <code>b</code> in <code>fLeaf</code> must be <code>FilePath</code>. What's left? <code>String -&gt; Tree FilePath Move</code> is what's left. The function takes a <code>FilePath</code> as input and returns a <code>String -&gt; Tree FilePath Move</code>. In other words, <code>c ~ String -&gt; Tree FilePath Move</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		How does that fit with <code>fNode</code>?
	</p>
	<p>
		Generically, this function must have the type <code>a -&gt; [c] -&gt; c</code>. We've already established that <code>c</code> must be <code>String -&gt; Tree FilePath Move</code>. Since the catamorphism runs on a <code>Tree FilePath FilePath</code>, we also know that <code>a</code> must be <code>FilePath</code>. Thus, plugging in all the types, <code>fNode</code> must have the type <code>FilePath -&gt; [String -&gt; Tree FilePath Move] -&gt; String -&gt; Tree FilePath Move</code>. Note, particularly, that the second argument is a list of functions. That's why I decided to name the parameter <code>fs</code>, for <em>functions</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The entire expression <code>foldTree fNode fLeaf t</code>, then, has the type <code>String -&gt; Tree FilePath Move</code>, since <code>c</code> is <code>String -&gt; Tree FilePath Move</code> and the return type of <code>foldTree</code> is <code>c</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The final trick is to apply this function to the initial relative path <code>""</code>, which returns a <code>Tree FilePath Move</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		This compiles and passes all tests. <code>calculateMoves</code> is now implemented using the <code>Tree</code> catamorphism, a goal that eluded me for more than one and a half years.
	</p>

	</h3>
	<p>
		With the Haskell proof of concept in place, it's fairly trivial to port the new implementation to the <a href="https://fsharp.org">F#</a> code base.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <code>calculateMoves</code> function originally looked like this:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:green;">//&nbsp;Tree&lt;string,FileInfo&gt;&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;Tree&lt;string,Move&gt;</span>
<span style="color:blue;">let</span>&nbsp;calculateMoves&nbsp;=
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">let</span>&nbsp;replaceDirectory&nbsp;(f&nbsp;:&nbsp;FileInfo)&nbsp;d&nbsp;=
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FileInfo&nbsp;(Path.Combine&nbsp;(d,&nbsp;f.Name))
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">let</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">rec</span>&nbsp;imp&nbsp;path&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">function</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;Leaf&nbsp;x&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">-&gt;</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaf&nbsp;{&nbsp;Source&nbsp;=&nbsp;x;&nbsp;Destination&nbsp;=&nbsp;replaceDirectory&nbsp;x&nbsp;path&nbsp;}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;Node&nbsp;(x,&nbsp;xs)&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">-&gt;</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">let</span>&nbsp;newNPath&nbsp;=&nbsp;Path.Combine&nbsp;(path,&nbsp;x)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tree.node&nbsp;newNPath&nbsp;(List.map&nbsp;(imp&nbsp;newNPath)&nbsp;xs)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;imp&nbsp;<span style="color:#a31515;">&quot;&quot;</span></pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		In the F# code base, the catamorphism is called <code>Tree.cata</code>, but otherwise looks like the Haskell <code>foldTree</code> function. The refactoring is also similar:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:green;">//&nbsp;Tree&lt;string,&nbsp;FileInfo&gt;&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;Tree&lt;string,&nbsp;Move&gt;</span>
<span style="color:blue;">let</span>&nbsp;calculateMoves&nbsp;t&nbsp;=
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:green;">//&nbsp;FileInfo&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;string&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;FileInfo</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">let</span>&nbsp;replaceDirectory&nbsp;(f&nbsp;:&nbsp;FileInfo)&nbsp;d&nbsp;=&nbsp;FileInfo&nbsp;(Path.Combine&nbsp;(d,&nbsp;f.Name))
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:green;">//&nbsp;FileInfo&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;string&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;Tree&lt;&#39;a,&nbsp;Move&gt;</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">let</span>&nbsp;fLeaf&nbsp;x&nbsp;path&nbsp;=&nbsp;Leaf&nbsp;{&nbsp;Source&nbsp;=&nbsp;x;&nbsp;Destination&nbsp;=&nbsp;replaceDirectory&nbsp;x&nbsp;path&nbsp;}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:green;">//&nbsp;string&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;(string&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;Tree&lt;string,&nbsp;&#39;a&gt;)&nbsp;list&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;string&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;Tree&lt;string,&nbsp;&#39;a&gt;</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">let</span>&nbsp;fNode&nbsp;x&nbsp;fs&nbsp;path&nbsp;=
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">let</span>&nbsp;newNPath&nbsp;=&nbsp;Path.Combine&nbsp;(path,&nbsp;x)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tree.node&nbsp;newNPath&nbsp;(List.map&nbsp;(<span style="color:blue;">fun</span>&nbsp;f&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">-&gt;</span>&nbsp;f&nbsp;newNPath)&nbsp;fs)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tree.cata&nbsp;fNode&nbsp;fLeaf&nbsp;t&nbsp;<span style="color:#a31515;">&quot;&quot;</span></pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		Again, the expression <code>Tree.cata fNode fLeaf t</code> has the type <code>string -&gt; Tree&lt;string, Move&gt;</code>, so applying it to <code>""</code> produces a <code>Tree&lt;string, Move&gt;</code> return value.
	</p>

	<p>
		I don't recall where I read the following, but I was under the impression that a data structure's catamorphism was its 'universal API', upon which you could implement any other functionality. I'd love it if it was true, but after my 2019 failure to implement <code>calculateMoves</code> via the <code>Tree</code> catamorphism, I wasn't sure if such a conjecture would hold.
	</p>
	<p>
		I still don't know if that assertion holds universally, but at least one reason to doubt it has now been removed.

				Excellent work Mark!  I too had not forgotten about this, and it nagged me as well.
			</p>
			<p>
				To some extent, I feel like your explanation of how to implement <code>calculateMoves</code> via <code>Tree.cata</code> is top-down.  By top-down, I mean it might depend on discovering the key idea of having <code>Tree.cata</code> return a function and then figuring out the correct type for that function.  A good thing about such top-down approaches is being immediately aware that a better solution likely exists even if it takes some time and effort to find it.
			</p>
			<p>
				I was curious if a bottom-up approach would work.  By bottom-up, I mean applying small refacorings to the code that are motivated by the principles, conventions, or style of functional programming.  I do think I found such an approach.  Of course it is a bit contradictory of me to only be able to find this approach after I read your presentation of the top-down approach.  However, I am thinking of it like a kata.  I now know such a bottom-up approach should be possible, and I want to find it.
			</p>
			<p>
				My bottom-up approach is in <a href="https://github.com/TysonMN/picture-archivist/tree/calculateMoves_via_cata_slow_refactor">this branch</a>.  Here is a brief summary of how I want myself to think of making those commits in that order.
			</p>
			<p>
				Each case of the discriminated union could be extracted to its own function.  This is easy to do in the <code>Leaf</code> case (so do it now), but it is not as easy to do in the <code>Node</code> case because of recursion, so delay that change for a bit.  If we did extract both functions though, both functions would include the argument that I called <code>pathToParent</code>.  Since it is passed in everywhere, it should be passed in nowhere (by eta reducing).  To do that, we need it to be the last parameter to <code>imp</code>.  After switching this order, we now deal with the recursion by doing it as soon as possible.  Then the remaining code in that case can be extracted, and <code>imp</code> is essentially <code>Tree.cata</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				In this approach, I never thought about the possibility of <code>Tree.cata</code> returning a function.  It just sort of fell out as a consequence of my other changes.

				Very nice! 
			</p>
			<p>
				In Haskell there is a library called <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/recursion-schemes-5.2.2.1">recursion-schemes</a> that showcases these types of recursion with catamorphisms, but also with many others recursion schemes. You can check it out and see if it gives you any new ideas.
			</p>
			<p>
				Regarding this use of catamorphism, the library itself I believe shows a very similar example <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/recursion-schemes-5.2.2.1/docs/Data-Functor-Foldable.html">here</a>, using the Reader type (which is isomorphic to the function you used in your example):
