<div id="post">
	<p>As some of my readers may already know, my (previous) employer Safewhere went out of business in August, so I started looking for something new to do. I believe that I have now found it.</p> <p>October 1st I'll start in my new role as Technical Lead at <a href="http://www.commentor.dk/">Commentor</a>, where it will be my responsibility to establish us as the leading Windows Azure center of expertise in Denmark (and beyond?). That's quite a big mouthful for me, but also something that I'm very excited about.</p> <p>This means that besides working on real Windows Azure projects with Danish customers, I also anticipate doing a lot of blogging, speaking and writing about Azure in the future.</p> <p>What does this mean for my many other endeavors, like <a href="http://amzn.to/12p90MG">my book</a>, <a href="http://autofixture.codeplex.com/">AutoFixture</a> or just blogging and speaking about TDD and DI in general? These things are something that I've always been doing mainly in my spare time, and I intend to keep doing that. Perhaps there are even better opportunities for synergy in my new line of work, but only time will tell.</p> <p>I'm really thrilled to be given the opportunity to expand in a slightly different direction. It'll be hard, but I'm sure it's also going to be a blast!</p>

	<div class="comment-content">From what I know of you from your blog and your excellent book, Commentor is lucky to have you. I am almost finished with your book Dependency Injection, and I am VERY impressed with it. I have put much of the knowledge to use on my current projects, which have made them much more testable. </div>
