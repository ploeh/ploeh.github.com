title: "Robust DI With the ASP.NET Web API"
---
{% include JB/setup %}

<div id="post">
	<p>Like the WCF Web API, the new <a href="http://www.asp.net/web-api">ASP.NET Web API</a> supports Dependency Injection (DI), but the approach is different and the resulting code you'll have to write is likely to be more complex. This post describes how to enable robust DI with the new Web API. Since this is based on the beta release, I hope that it will become easier in the final release.</p> <p>At first glance, enabling DI on an ASP.NET Web API <a href="http://www.asp.net/web-api/overview/extensibility/using-the-web-api-dependency-resolver">looks seductively simple</a>. As always, though, the devil is in the details. <a href="http://www.nikosbaxevanis.com/bonus-bits/">Nikos Baxevanis</a> has already provided a <a href="http://www.nikosbaxevanis.com/bonus-bits/2012/03/using-the-web-api-dependency-resolver-with-castle-windsor.html">more thorough description</a>, but it's even more tricky than that.</p> <p><strong>Protocol</strong></p> <p>To enable DI, all you have to do is to call the SetResolver method, right? It even has an overload that enables you to supply two code blocks instead of implementing an interface (although you can certainly also implement IDependencyResolver). Could it be any easier than that?</p> <p>Yes, it most certainly could.</p> <p>Imagine that you'd like to hook up your DI Container of choice. As a first attempt, you try something like this:</p> <div style="font-family: consolas, 'Courier New'; background: white; color: black; font-size: 10pt"><pre style="margin: 0px"><span style="color: #2b91af">GlobalConfiguration</span>.Configuration.ServiceResolver.SetResolver(</pre><pre style="margin: 0px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; t =&gt; <span style="color: blue">this</span>.container.Resolve(t),</pre><pre style="margin: 0px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; t =&gt; <span style="color: blue">this</span>.container.ResolveAll(t).Cast&lt;<span style="color: blue">object</span>&gt;());</pre></div>
<p>This compiles. Does it work? Yes, but in a rather scary manner. Although it satisfies the interface, it doesn't satisfy the <em>protocol</em> ("an interface describes whether two components will <em>fit</em> together, while a protocol describes whether they will <em>work</em> together." (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321503627/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ploeh-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0321503627">GOOS</a>, p. 58)).</p>
<p>The protocol, in this case, is that if you (or rather the container) can't resolve the type, you should return null. What's even worse is that <em>if</em> your code throws an exception (<em>any</em> exception, apparently), DependencyResolver will suppress it. In case you didn't know, this is strongly frowned upon in the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms229005.aspx">.NET Framework Design Guidelines</a>.</p>
<p>Even so, the official introduction article instead chooses to play along with the protocol and explicitly handle any exceptions. Something along the lines of this ugly code:</p>
<div style="font-family: consolas, 'Courier New'; background: white; color: black; font-size: 10pt"><pre style="margin: 0px"><span style="color: #2b91af">GlobalConfiguration</span>.Configuration.ServiceResolver.SetResolver(</pre><pre style="margin: 0px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; t =&gt;</pre><pre style="margin: 0px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {</pre><pre style="margin: 0px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue">try</span></pre><pre style="margin: 0px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {</pre><pre style="margin: 0px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue">return</span> <span style="color: blue">this</span>.container.Resolve(t);</pre><pre style="margin: 0px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</pre><pre style="margin: 0px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue">catch</span> (<span style="color: #2b91af">ComponentNotFoundException</span>)</pre><pre style="margin: 0px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {</pre><pre style="margin: 0px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue">return</span> <span style="color: blue">null</span>;</pre><pre style="margin: 0px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</pre><pre style="margin: 0px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; },</pre><pre style="margin: 0px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; t =&gt;</pre><pre style="margin: 0px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {</pre><pre style="margin: 0px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue">try</span></pre><pre style="margin: 0px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {</pre><pre style="margin: 0px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue">return</span> <span style="color: blue">this</span>.container.ResolveAll(t).Cast&lt;<span style="color: blue">object</span>&gt;();</pre><pre style="margin: 0px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</pre><pre style="margin: 0px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue">catch</span> (<span style="color: #2b91af">ComponentNotFoundException</span>)</pre><pre style="margin: 0px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {</pre><pre style="margin: 0px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue">return</span> <span style="color: blue">new</span> <span style="color: #2b91af">List</span>&lt;<span style="color: blue">object</span>&gt;();</pre><pre style="margin: 0px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</pre><pre style="margin: 0px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</pre><pre style="margin: 0px">);</pre></div>
<p>Notice how try/catch is used for control flow  -  another <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms229030.aspx">major no no in the .NET Framework Design Guidelines</a>.</p>
<p>At least with a good DI Container, we can do something like this instead:</p>
<div style="font-family: consolas, 'Courier New'; background: white; color: black; font-size: 10pt"><pre style="margin: 0px"><span style="color: #2b91af">GlobalConfiguration</span>.Configuration.ServiceResolver.SetResolver(</pre><pre style="margin: 0px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; t =&gt; <span style="color: blue">this</span>.container.Kernel.HasComponent(t) ?</pre><pre style="margin: 0px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue">this</span>.container.Resolve(t) :</pre><pre style="margin: 0px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue">null</span>,</pre><pre style="margin: 0px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; t =&gt; <span style="color: blue">this</span>.container.ResolveAll(t).Cast&lt;<span style="color: blue">object</span>&gt;());</pre></div>
<p>Still, first impressions don't exactly inspire trust in the implementation...</p>
<p><strong>API Design Issues</strong></p>
<p>Next, I would like to direct your attention to the DependencyResolver API. At its core, it looks like this:</p>
<div style="font-family: consolas, 'Courier New'; background: white; color: black; font-size: 10pt"><pre style="margin: 0px"><span style="color: blue">public</span> <span style="color: blue">interface</span> <span style="color: #2b91af">IDependencyResolver</span></pre><pre style="margin: 0px">{</pre><pre style="margin: 0px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue">object</span> GetService(<span style="color: #2b91af">Type</span> serviceType);</pre><pre style="margin: 0px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: #2b91af">IEnumerable</span>&lt;<span style="color: blue">object</span>&gt; GetServices(<span style="color: #2b91af">Type</span> serviceType);</pre><pre style="margin: 0px">}</pre></div>
<p>It can create objects, but what about decommissioning? What if, deep in a dependency graph, a Controller contains an IDisposable object? This is not a particularly exotic scenario  -  it might be an instance of an Entity Framework <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.objects.objectcontext.aspx">ObjectContext</a>. While an ApiController itself implements IDisposable, it may not know that it contains an injected object graph with one or more IDisposable leaf nodes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's a fundamental rule of DI that you must <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2010/09/29/TheRegisterResolveReleasePattern.aspx">Release what you Resolve</a>. That's not possible with the DependencyResolver API. The result may be memory leaks.</p></blockquote>
<p>Fortunately, it turns out that there's a fix for this (at least for Controllers). Unfortunately, this workaround leverages another design problem with DependencyResolver.</p>
<p><strong>Mixed Responsibilities</strong></p>
<p>It turns out that when you wire a custom resolver up with the SetResolver method, the ASP.NET Web API will query your custom resolver (such as a DI Container) for not only your application classes, but also for its own infrastructure components. That surprised me a bit because of the mixed responsibility, but at least this is a useful hook.</p>
<p>One of the first types the framework will ask for is an instance of IHttpControllerFactory, which looks like this:</p>
<div style="font-family: consolas, 'Courier New'; background: white; color: black; font-size: 10pt"><pre style="margin: 0px"><span style="color: blue">public</span> <span style="color: blue">interface</span> <span style="color: #2b91af">IHttpControllerFactory</span></pre><pre style="margin: 0px">{</pre><pre style="margin: 0px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IHttpController CreateController(HttpControllerContext controllerContext,</pre><pre style="margin: 0px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue">string</span> controllerName);</pre><pre style="margin: 0px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue">void</span> ReleaseController(IHttpController controller);</pre><pre style="margin: 0px">}</pre></div>
<p>Fortunately, this interface has a Release hook, so at least it's possible to release Controller instances, which is most important because there will be a lot of them (one per HTTP request).</p>
<p><strong>Discoverability Issues</strong></p>
<p>The IHttpControllerFactory looks a lot like the well-known ASP.NET MVC <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.mvc.icontrollerfactory%28v=vs.98%29.aspx">IControllerFactory</a> interface, but there are subtle differences. In ASP.NET MVC, there's a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.mvc.defaultcontrollerfactory%28v=vs.98%29.aspx">DefaultControllerFactory</a> with appropriate virtual methods one can overwrite (it follows the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_method_pattern">Template Method</a> pattern).</p>
<p>There's also a DefaultControllerFactory in the Web API, but unfortunately no Template Methods to override. While I <em>could</em> write an algorithm that maps from the <em>controllerName</em> parameter to a type which can be passed to a DI Container, I'd rather prefer to be able to reuse the implementation which the DefaultControllerFactory contains.</p>
<p>In ASP.NET MVC, this is possible by overriding the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee264052%28v=vs.98%29.aspx">GetControllerInstance</a> method, but it turns out that the Web API (beta) does this slightly differently. It favors composition over inheritance (which is actually a good thing, so kudos for that), so after mapping <em>controllerName</em> to a Type instance, it invokes an instance of the IHttpControllerActivator interface (did I hear anyone say "FactoryFactory?"). Very loosely coupled (good), but not very discoverable (not so good). It would have been more discoverable if DefaultControllerFactory had used Constructor Injection to get its dependency, rather than relying on the <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2010/02/03/ServiceLocatorIsAnAntiPattern.aspx">Service Locator</a> which DependencyResolver really is.</p>
<p>However, this is only an issue if you need to hook into the Controller creation process, e.g. in order to capture the HttpControllerContext for further use. In normal scenarios, despite what Nikos Baxevanis describes in his blog post, you don't <em>have</em> to override or implement IHttpControllerFactory.CreateController. The DependencyResolver infrastructure will automatically invoke your GetService implementation (or the corresponding code block) whenever a Controller instance is required.</p>
<p><strong>Releasing Controllers</strong></p>
<p>The easiest way to make sure that all Controller instances are being properly released is to derive a class from DefaultControllerFactory and override the ReleaseController method:</p>
<div style="font-family: consolas, 'Courier New'; background: white; color: black; font-size: 10pt"><pre style="margin: 0px"><span style="color: blue">public</span> <span style="color: blue">class</span> <span style="color: #2b91af">ReleasingControllerFactory</span> : <span style="color: #2b91af">DefaultHttpControllerFactory</span></pre><pre style="margin: 0px">{</pre><pre style="margin: 0px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue">private</span> <span style="color: blue">readonly</span> <span style="color: #2b91af">Action</span>&lt;<span style="color: blue">object</span>&gt; release;</pre><pre style="margin: 0px">&nbsp;</pre><pre style="margin: 0px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue">public</span> ReleasingControllerFactory(<span style="color: #2b91af">Action</span>&lt;<span style="color: blue">object</span>&gt; releaseCallback,</pre><pre style="margin: 0px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: #2b91af">HttpConfiguration</span> configuration)</pre><pre style="margin: 0px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : <span style="color: blue">base</span>(configuration)</pre><pre style="margin: 0px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {</pre><pre style="margin: 0px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue">this</span>.release = releaseCallback;</pre><pre style="margin: 0px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</pre><pre style="margin: 0px">&nbsp;</pre><pre style="margin: 0px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue">public</span> <span style="color: blue">override</span> <span style="color: blue">void</span> ReleaseController(<span style="color: #2b91af">IHttpController</span> controller)</pre><pre style="margin: 0px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {</pre><pre style="margin: 0px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue">this</span>.release(controller);</pre><pre style="margin: 0px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue">base</span>.ReleaseController(controller);</pre><pre style="margin: 0px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</pre><pre style="margin: 0px">}</pre></div>
<p>Notice that it's not necessary to override the CreateController method, since the default implementation is good enough  -  it'll ask the DependencyResolver for an instance of IHttpControllerActivator, which will again ask the DependencyResolver for an instance of the Controller type, in the end invoking your custom GetObject implemention.</p>
<p>To keep the above example generic, I just injected an Action&lt;object&gt; into ReleasingControllerFactory  -  I really don't wish to turn this into a discussion about the merits and demerits of various DI Containers. In any case, I'll leave it as an exercise to you to wire up your favorite DI Container so that the <em>releaseCallback</em> is actually a call to the container's Release method.</p>
<p><strong>Lifetime Cycles of Infrastructure Components</strong></p>
<p>Before I conclude, I'd like to point out another <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment">POLA</a> violation that hit me during my investigation.</p>
<p>The ASP.NET Web API utilizes DependencyResolver to resolve its own infrastructure types (such as IHttpControllerFactory, IHttpControllerActivator, etc.). Any custom DependencyResolver you supply will also be queried for these types. However:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When resolving infrastructure components, the Web API doesn't respect any custom lifecycle you may have defined for these components.</p></blockquote>
<p>At a certain point while I investigated this, I wanted to configure a custom IHttpControllerActivator to have a <em>Web Request Context</em> (<a href="http://affiliate.manning.com/idevaffiliate.php?id=1150_236">my book</a>, section 8.3.4)  -  in other words, I wanted to create a new instance of IHttpControllerActivator for each incoming HTTP request.</p>
<p>This is not possible. The framework queries a custom DependencyResolver for an infrastructure type, but <em>even when it receives an instance</em> (i.e. not null), it doesn't trust the DependencyResolver to efficiently manage the lifetime of that instance. Instead, it caches this instance for ever, and never asks for it again. This is, in my opinion, a mistaken responsibility, and I hope it will be corrected in the final release.</p>
<p><strong>Concluding Thoughts</strong></p>
<p>Wiring up the ASP.NET Web API with robust DI is possible, but much harder than it ought to be. Suggestions for improvements are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Release hook in DependencyResolver. 
<li>The framework itself should trust the DependencyResolver to efficiently manage lifetime of all objects it create.</li></ul>
<p>As I've described, there are other places were minor adjustments would be helpful, but these two suggestions are the most important ones.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong> (2012.03.21): I've posted this feedback to the product group on <a href="http://aspnet.uservoice.com/forums/147201-asp-net-web-api/suggestions/2701848-clean-up-dependency-injection-support">uservoice</a> and <a href="https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/732337/clean-up-dependency-injection-support-in-asp-net-web-api">Connect</a>  -  if you agree, please visit those sites and vote up the issues.</p>

Won't happen.  The release issue was highlighted during the RCs and Beta releases and the feedback from Brad Wilson was they were not going to add a release mechanism :(<br>
<br>
The same applies to the *Activators that where added (IViewPageActivator, etc.), they really need a release hook too</div>

	<div class="comment-content">That's the kind of problems when you use a framework that considers DI a second citizen and not really something that is bundled in the heart of it.<br>
I know for some people is not an option whether use or not what MVC produces, if you are not one of them, I suggest you give a try to FubuMVC, a MVC framework built from the beginning with DI in mind.<br>
It has its own shortcoming, but the advantages surpasses the problems. <br>
The issue you had about not releasing disposable objects is simply non an issue in FubuMVC.<br>
Kind regards,<br>
Jaime.</div>

	<div class="comment-content">Jaime, yes, I'm aware of FubuMVC, but have never tried it for a couple of reasons.<br>
<br>
First of all, right now I need a framework for building REST services, and not a web framework. FubuMVC might have gained REST features (such as conneg) since last I looked, but the ASP.NET Web API does have quite an attractive feature set for building REST APIs.<br>
<br>
Secondly, last time I discussed the issue of releasing components, Jeremy Miller was very much against it. StructureMap doesn't have a Release hook, so I wonder whether FubuMVC does...<br>
<br>
Personally, I'm not against trying other technologies, and I've previously looked a bit at OpenRasta and Nancy. However, many of my clients prefer Microsoft technologies.<br>
<br>
I must also admit to be somewhat taken aback by the direction Microsoft has taken here. The WCF Web API was really good, so I also felt it was my duty to provide feedback to Microsoft as well as the community about this.</div>

	<div class="comment-content">Hi Mark,<br>
Yes, SM does not have a built-in release hook, I agree on that, but fubumvc uses something called &quot;NestedContainer&quot;.<br>
<br>
This nested container shares the same settings of your top level container (often StructureMap.ObjectFactory.Container), but with one added bonus, on disposal, also disposes any disposable dependency it resolved during the request lifetime.<br>
<br>
And all of this is controller by behaviors that wrap an action call at runtime (but configured at start-up), sorta a &quot;Russian Doll Model&quot; like fubu folks like to call to this.<br>
So all these behaviors wrap each other, allowing you to effectively dispose resources.<br>
To avoid giving wrong explanations, I better share a link which already does this in an effective way:<br>
http://codebetter.com/jeremymiller/2011/01/09/fubumvcs-internal-runtime-the-russian-doll-model-and-how-it-compares-to-asp-net-mvc-and-openrasta/<br>
<br>
And by no means, don't take my words as a harsh opinion against MS MVC, it just a matter of preferences, if to people out there MS MVC or ASP.Net Web API solves their needs, I will not try to convince you otherwise.<br>
<br>
Kind regards,<br>
Jaime.<br>

<br>
I've found this article very useful in understanding the use of Windsor with Web API, and I am now wondering whether anything has changed in the RC of MVC 4 that would make any part of this method redundant?
