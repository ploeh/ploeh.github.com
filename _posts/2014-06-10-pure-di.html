    <strong>TL;DR: the term <em>Pure DI</em> replaces the term <em>Poor Man's DI</em>.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    This post essentially proposes a change of terminology. In <a href="http://amzn.to/12p90MG">my book about Dependency Injection</a> (DI), I was careful to explain the principles and patterns of DI in the pure form, without involving DI Containers. Only in Part 4 do you get extensive coverage of various DI Containers, and even here, what you learn is how the DI principles and patterns map to the various containers.
  </p>
  <p>
    DI is a set of principles and patterns; DI Containers are <em>optional</em> helper libraries.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, when I wrote the book, I made a mistake (I probably made many, but here, I'll address a single, specific mistake): in the book, DI without DI Containers is called <em>Poor Man's DI</em>. There are <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/7102651/126014">reasons for that</a>, but eventually, I've learned that Poor Man's DI is poor terminology (pun intended). The problem is that it sounds slightly derogatory, or at least unattractive; it also doesn't communicate the message that DI without a DI Container is, in many cases, <em>better</em> than DI with a DI Container - on the contrary, it sounds like it's not as good.
  </p>
  <p>
    Apart from my book, I've attempted to describe the trade-off involved in going from Poor Man's DI to using a DI Container in various articles:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/2012/11/06/WhentouseaDIContainer">When to use a DI Container</a></li>
      <li><a href="/2014/06/03/compile-time-lifetime-matching">Compile Time Lifetime Matching</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/Succeeding-Dependency-Injection">Succeeding with Dependency Injection</a></li>
    </ul>
    Based on the reactions I've received, it seems like my readers really like their DI Containers. Perhaps they're just afraid of the alternative, because it's called Poor Man's DI.
  </p>
  <p>
    For these reasons, from now on, I'll retire the term <em>Poor Man's DI</em>, and instead start using the term <em><strong>Pure DI</strong></em>. Pure DI is when you use the DI principles and patterns, but not a DI Container; it's what I've been doing for the last 1½ years, as well as many years before I wrote my book.

    <strong>P.S. 2018-04-15.</strong> Naming is hard. When I came up with the alternative name of <em>Pure DI</em>, I was already in the process of changing my focus to functional programming, but at that time, I'd still not realised how big a role <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_transparency">referential transparency</a> plays in strictly functional languages like <a href="https://www.haskell.org">Haskell</a>, with its emphasis on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function">pure functions</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The purity implied by <em>Pure DI</em>, unfortunately, has nothing to do with purity in the functional sense of the word. In fact, <a href="/2017/01/30/partial-application-is-dependency-injection">DI makes everything impure</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    When I decided on the term <em>Pure DI</em>, I did it because it sounds vaguely like <em>Poor Man's DI</em>, so that it'd be easy to remember. Additionally, I picked the word <em>pure</em> because it can mean <em>essence</em>, and I thought that, in a sense, <em>Pure DI</em> can be viewed as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_idealism">Platonic ideal</a> of DI. Finally, <em>pure</em> sounds like something desirable, so because of those reasons, I believed that it'd be a good term. People seem to have picked it up, so in that sense I think that I chose the right word, but it can be confusing if viewed through the lens of functional programming terminology.

  <p>
    <em>Pure DI</em> has nothing to do with pure functions.
