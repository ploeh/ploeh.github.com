Compared to the Release Candidate, there are no changes.</p> <p>The <a href="http://autofixture.codeplex.com/releases/view/43351">1.1 release page</a> has more details about this particular release, but essentially this is the RC promoted to release status.</p> <p>Release 1.1 is an interim release that addresses a few issues that appeared since the release of version 1.0.
