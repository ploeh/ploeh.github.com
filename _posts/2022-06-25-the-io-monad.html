		This article is an instalment in <a href="/2022/03/28/monads">an article series about monads</a>. A previous article described <a href="/2020/06/22/the-io-functor">the IO functor</a>. As is the case with many (but not all) <a href="/2018/03/22/functors">functors</a>, this one also forms a monad.

	<p>
		A monad must define either a <em>bind</em> or <em>join</em> function. In C#, monadic bind is called <code>SelectMany</code>. In a recent article, I gave an example of <a href="/2020/06/15/io-container-in-a-parallel-c-universe">what <em>IO</em> might look like in C#</a>. Notice that it already comes with a <code>SelectMany</code> function:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;IO&lt;TResult&gt;&nbsp;<span style="color:#74531f;">SelectMany</span>&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af;">TResult</span>&gt;(Func&lt;T,&nbsp;IO&lt;TResult&gt;&gt;&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">selector</span>)</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		Unlike other monads, the IO implementation is considered a black box, but if you're interested in a prototypical implementation, I already posted <a href="/2020/07/13/implementation-of-the-c-io-container">a sketch</a> in 2020.

	</h3>
	<p>
		I have also, already, demonstrated <a href="/2020/06/29/syntactic-sugar-for-io">syntactic sugar for IO</a>. In that article, however, I used an implementation of the required <code>SelectMany</code> overload that is more explicit than it has to be. The <a href="/2022/03/28/monads">monad introduction</a> makes the prediction that you can always implement that overload in the same way, and yet here I didn't.
	</p>
	<p>
		That's an oversight on my part. You can implement it like this instead:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">static</span>&nbsp;IO&lt;TResult&gt;&nbsp;<span style="color:#74531f;">SelectMany</span>&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af;">T</span>,&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">U</span>,&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">TResult</span>&gt;(
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">this</span>&nbsp;IO&lt;T&gt;&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">source</span>,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Func&lt;T,&nbsp;IO&lt;U&gt;&gt;&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">k</span>,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Func&lt;T,&nbsp;U,&nbsp;TResult&gt;&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">s</span>)
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#8f08c4;">return</span>&nbsp;source.SelectMany(<span style="color:#1f377f;">x</span>&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;k(x).Select(<span style="color:#1f377f;">y</span>&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;s(x,&nbsp;y)));
}</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		Indeed, the conjecture from the introduction still holds.
	</p>

	<p>
		In <a href="/2022/03/28/monads">the introduction</a> you learned that if you have a <code>Flatten</code> or <code>Join</code> function, you can implement <code>SelectMany</code>, and the other way around. Since we've already defined <code>SelectMany</code> for <code>IO&lt;T&gt;</code>, we can use that to implement <code>Join</code>. In this article I use the name <code>Join</code> rather than <code>Flatten</code>. This is an arbitrary choice that doesn't impact behaviour. Perhaps you find it confusing that I'm inconsistent, but I do it in order to demonstrate that the behaviour is the same even if the name is different.
	</p>
	<p>
		The concept of a monad is universal, but the names used to describe its components differ from language to language. What C# calls <code>SelectMany</code>, Scala calls <code>flatMap</code>, and what <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> calls <code>join</code>, other languages may call <code>Flatten</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can always implement <code>Join</code> by using <code>SelectMany</code> with the identity function:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">static</span>&nbsp;IO&lt;T&gt;&nbsp;<span style="color:#74531f;">Join</span>&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af;">T</span>&gt;(<span style="color:blue;">this</span>&nbsp;IO&lt;IO&lt;T&gt;&gt;&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">source</span>)
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#8f08c4;">return</span>&nbsp;source.SelectMany(<span style="color:#1f377f;">x</span>&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;x);
}</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		In C# the identity function is <a href="/2015/08/03/idiomatic-or-idiosyncratic">idiomatically</a> given as the lambda expression <code><span style="color:#1f377f;">x</span>&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;x</code> since C# doesn't come with a built-in identity function.
	</p>

		Return <a href="#c57bcf1e74144046bc7191280d78519b" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		Apart from monadic bind, a monad must also define a way to put a normal value into the monad. Conceptually, I call this function <em>return</em> (because that's the name that Haskell uses). In <a href="/2020/06/22/the-io-functor">the IO functor</a> article, I wrote that the <code>IO&lt;T&gt;</code> constructor corresponds to <em>return</em>. That's not strictly true, though, since the constructor takes a <code>Func&lt;T&gt;</code> and not a <code>T</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		This issue is, however, trivially addressed:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">static</span>&nbsp;IO&lt;T&gt;&nbsp;<span style="color:#74531f;">Return</span>&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af;">T</span>&gt;(T&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">x</span>)
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#8f08c4;">return</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">new</span>&nbsp;IO&lt;T&gt;(()&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;x);
}</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		Take the value <code>x</code> and wrap it in a lazily-evaluated function.
	</p>

	<p>
		While <a href="/2020/07/06/referential-transparency-of-io">IO values are referentially transparent</a> you can't compare them. You also can't 'run' them by other means than running a program. This makes it hard to talk meaningfully about the <a href="/2022/04/11/monad-laws">monad laws</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, the left identity law is:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>return &gt;=&gt; h ≡ h</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		Note the implied equality. The composition of <code>return</code> and <code>h</code> should be equal to <code>h</code>, for some reasonable definition of equality. How do we define that?
	</p>
	<p>
		Somehow we must imagine that two alternative compositions would produce the same observable effects <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceteris_paribus">ceteris paribus</a>. If you somehow imagine that you have two parallel universes, one with one composition (say <code>return &gt;=&gt; h</code>) and one with another (<code>h</code>), if all else in those two universes were equal, then you would observe no difference in behaviour.
	</p>
	<p>
		That may be useful as a thought experiment, but isn't particularly practical. Unfortunately, due to side effects, things <em>do</em> change when non-deterministic behaviour and side effects are involved. As a simple example, consider an IO action that gets the current time and prints it to the console. That involves both non-determinism and a side effect.
	</p>
	<p>
		In Haskell, that's a straightforward composition of two <code>IO</code> actions:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>&gt; h () = getCurrentTime &gt;>= print</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		How do we compare two compositions? By running them?
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>&gt; return () &gt;&gt;= h
2022-06-25 16:47:30.6540847 UTC
&gt; h ()
2022-06-25 16:47:37.5281265 UTC</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		The outputs are not the same, because time goes by. Can we thereby conclude that the monad laws don't hold for IO? Not quite.
	</p>
	<p>
		The IO Container is referentially transparent, but evaluation isn't. Thus, we have to pretend that two alternatives will lead to the same evaluation behaviour, all things being equal.
	</p>
	<p>
		This property seems to hold for both the identity and associativity laws. Whether or not you compose with <em>return</em>, or in which evaluation order you compose actions, it doesn't affect the outcome.
	</p>
	<p>
		For completeness sake, the <a href="/2020/07/13/implementation-of-the-c-io-container">C# implementation sketch</a> is just a wrapper over a <code>Func&lt;T&gt;</code>. We can also think of such a function as a function from <a href="/2018/01/15/unit-isomorphisms">unit</a> to <code>T</code> - in pseudo-C# <code>() =&gt; T</code>. That's a function; in other words: <a href="">The Reader monad</a>. We already know that the Reader monad obeys the monad laws, so the C# implementation, at least, should be okay.

	<p>
		IO forms a monad, among other abstractions. This is what enables Haskell programmers to compose an arbitrary number of impure actions with monadic bind without ever having to force evaluation. In C# <a href="/2020/06/15/io-container-in-a-parallel-c-universe">it might have looked the same</a>, except that it doesn't.
