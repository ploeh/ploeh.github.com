title: "AutoFixture goes Continuous Delivery with Semantic Versioning"

<div id="post">
	<p>For the last couple of months I've been working on setting up <a href="http://autofixture.codeplex.com/">AutoFixture</a> for Continuous Delivery (thanks to the nice people at <a title="http://teamcity.codebetter.com/" href="http://teamcity.codebetter.com/">http://teamcity.codebetter.com/</a> for supplying the CI service) and I think I've finally succeeded. I've just pushed some code from my local Mercurial repository, and 5 minutes later the release is <a href="http://autofixture.codeplex.com/releases/view/72947">live on both the CodePlex site</a> as well as <a href="http://nuget.org/List/Search?searchTerm=autofixture">on the NuGet Gallery</a>.</p> <p>The plan for AutoFixture going forward is to maintain Continuous Delivery and switch the versioning scheme from ad hoc to <a href="http://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning</a>. This means that obviously you'll see releases much more often, and versions are going to be incremented much more often. Since the previous release the current release incidentally ended at version 2.2.44, but since the versioning scheme has now changed, you can expect to see 2.3, 2.4 etc. in rapid succession.</p> <p>While I've been mostly focused on setting up Continuous Delivery, <a href="http://www.nikosbaxevanis.com/bonus-bits/">Nikos Baxevanis</a> and <a href="http://megakemp.wordpress.com/">Enrico Campidoglio</a> have been busy writing new features:</p> <ul> <li><a href="http://megakemp.wordpress.com/2011/08/01/anonymous-delegates-in-autofixture/">Support for anonymous delegates</a>  <li><a href="http://www.nikosbaxevanis.com/bonus-bits/2011/08/heuristics-for-static-factory-methods-in-autofixture.html">Heuristics for static factory methods</a>  <li><a href="http://www.nikosbaxevanis.com/bonus-bits/2011/08/combining-xunit-data-theories.html">Inline AutoData Theories</a>  <li><a href="http://megakemp.wordpress.com/2011/09/06/behavior-changes-in-autofixture-2-2-anonymous-numbers/">More anonymous numbers</a></li></ul> <p>Apart from these excellent contributions, other new features are</p> <ul> <li><a href="/2011/04/18/EnumerablesaredynamicalsoinAutoFixture">Added StableFiniteSequenceCustomization</a>  <li>Added [FavorArrays], [FavorEnumerables] and [FavorLists] attributes to xUnit.net extension  <li>Added a Generator&lt;T&gt; class  <li>Added a completely new project/package called <em>Idioms</em>, which contains convention-based tests (more about this later)  <li>Probably some other things I've forgotten about…</li></ul> <p>While you can expect to see version numbers to increase more rapidly and releases to occur more frequently, I'm also beginning to think about AutoFixture 3.0. This release will streamline some of the API in the root namespace, which, I'll admit, was always a bit haphazard. For those people who care, I have no plans to touch the API in the Ploeh.AutoFixture.Kernel namespace. AutoFixture 3.0 will mainly target the API contained in the Ploeh.AutoFixture namespace itself.</p> <p>Some of the changes I have in mind will hopefully make the default experience with AutoFixture more pleasant  -  I'm unofficially thinking about AutoFixture 3.0 as the ‘pit of success' release. It will also enable some of the various <a href="http://autofixture.codeplex.com/workitem/list/basic">outstanding feature requests</a>.</p> <p>Feedback is, as usual, appreciated.</p>
