		<em>My book </em>Dependency Injection in .NET<em> has received a Jolt Productivity Award!</em>
	</p>
	<p>
		It turns out that my book <a href="http://amzn.to/12p90MG">Dependency Injection in .NET</a> has received a <a href="http://www.drdobbs.com/joltawards/jolt-awards-the-best-books/240162065?pgno=5">Jolt Productivity Award 2013</a> in the <a href="http://www.drdobbs.com/joltawards/jolt-awards-the-best-books/240162065?pgno=1">Best Books category</a>. This is a completely unexpected (but obviously very pleasant) surprise :D

	</p>
	<p>
		The motivation for giving the award states that it:
	</p>
	<p>
		<blockquote>
			"provide[s] a brilliant and remarkably readable explanation of DI"
		</blockquote>
	</p>
	<p>
		and concludes that
	</p>
	<p>
		<blockquote>
			"It's the definitive guide to DI and the first place architects and implementers should turn for a truly deep and complete understanding of the pattern — regardless of whether .NET is part of their toolkit.""
		</blockquote>
	</p>
	<p>
		Although it's already been selling well, the book is still available either <a href="http://www.manning.com/seemann">directly from Manning</a>, or via <a href="http://amzn.to/12p90MG">Amazon.com</a> - and, in case you didn't know, every time you buy a Manning book, you automatically also get the electronic version, which (in the case of my book), includes a Kindle version, as well as a PDF. You can also skip the physical copy and buy only the electronic version, but this option is (AFAIK) only available <a href="http://www.manning.com/seemann">from Manning</a>.

	<p>
		What an honor!
