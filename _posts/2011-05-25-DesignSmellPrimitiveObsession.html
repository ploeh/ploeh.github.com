<div id="post">
	<p>This post is the second in a series about <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2011/05/24/PokayokeDesignFromSmellToFragrance.aspx">Poka-yoke Design</a>  -  also known as <em>encapsulation</em>.</p> <p>Many classes have a tendency to consume or expose primitive values like integers and strings. While such primitive types exist on any platform, they tend to lead to procedural code. Furthermore they often break encapsulation by allowing invalid values to be assigned.</p> <p>This problem has been addressed many times before. Years ago <a href="http://lostechies.com/jimmybogard/">Jimmy Bogard</a> provided an <a href="http://grabbagoft.blogspot.com/2007/12/dealing-with-primitive-obsession.html">excellent treatment of the issue, as well as guidance on how to resolve it</a>. In relation to <a href="http://autofixture.codeplex.com/">AutoFixture</a> I also <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2009/05/01/DealingWithConstrainedInput.aspx">touched upon the subject some time ago</a>. As such, the current post is mostly a placeholder.</p> <p>However, it's worth noting that both Jimmy's and my own post address the concern that strings and integers do not sufficiently encapsulate the concepts of Zip codes and phone numbers.</p> <ul> <li>When a Zip code is represented as a string it's possible to assign values such as null, string.Emtpy, “foo”, very long strings, etc. Jimmy's ZipCode class encapsulates the concept by guaranteeing that an instance can only be successfully created with a correct value.  <li>When a Danish phone number is represented as an integer it's possible to assign values such as  - 98, 0, int.MaxValue, etc. Once again the DanishPhoneNumber class from the above example encapsulates the concept by guaranteeing that an instance can only be successfully created with a correct value.</li></ul> <p>Encapsulation is broken unless the concept represented by a primitive value can truly take <em>any</em> of the possible values of the primitive type. This is rarely the case.</p> <p><strong>Design Smell:</strong></p> <p>A class consumes a primitive type. However, further analysis shows that not all possible values of the type are legal values.</p> <p><strong>Improved Design:</strong></p> <p>Encapsulate the primitive value in a Value Object that contains appropriate Guard Clauses etc. to guarantee that only valid instances are possible.</p> <p>Primitives tend to not be fail-safe, but encapsulated Value Objects are.</p>

<br>
Encapsulation is broken unless the concept represented by a primitive value can truly take any of the possible values of the primitive type. This is rarely the case.<br>
<br>
Should a Qty field that only takes positive integers now be represented by a separate class?  You seem to be defining encapsulation as compile-safe or something.</div>

	<div class="comment-content">I would very much like to be able to represent a quantity as a specialized class. Unfortunately <i>uint</i> is not a CLS-compliant type - otherwise I would use that one a lot.<br>
<br>
Keep in mind that I'm talking about a code smell. This means that whenever you encounter the smell it should make you stop and think. I'm not saying that using a primitive type is <i>always</i> wrong.<br>
<br>
With a quantity, and given the constraints of C#, unfortunately there isn't a lot we can do. While we could encapsulate it in a PositiveInteger struct, it wouldn't add much value from a feedback perspective since we can't make the compiler choke on a negative value.<br>
<br>
However, a hypothetical PositiveInteger struct would still add the value that it encapsulates the invariant in one place instead of spreading it out all over the code base.<br>
<br>
Still, a positive integer is such a basic concept that it never changes. This means that even if you spread Guard Clauses that check for negative values all over your code base, you may not have much of a maintenance burden, since the Guard will never change. Still, you might forget it in a couple of places.<br>
<br>
In any case I like the Temperature example above much better because it not only provides safety, but also encapsulates the concept as well as provides conversion logic etc.</div>

	<div class="comment-content">I try whenever possible to design that way my api especially in the domain layer. However I run into some corner cases with RESTful web services when it's more convenient for the client to provide a simple primitive than the complex object. Then on the server side the check is done to know if the provided value is correct. Would you bother to enforce it that case?</div>
