<div id="post">
	<p>
		A couple of days ago I released <a href="http://autofixture.codeplex.com/">AutoFixture</a> .8.4. It contains a few small feature additions and a bug fix. You can get it at the <a href="http://autofixture.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=29096">AutoFixture CodePlex site</a> as usual.
	</p>
	<p>
		You may have noticed that I'm frequently releasing incremental versions these days. This is because we have begun using AutoFixture for writing production software at <a href="http://www.safewhere.net/">Safewhere</a>. So far, it has been a pleasure to use AutoFixture in my daily work, and watch colleagues pick it up and run with it.
	</p>
	<p>
		Such intensive usage obviously uncovers missing features as well as a few bugs, which is the driving force behind the frequent releases. I've been happy to observe that so far, there have been only a few bugs, and the general API is very expressive and useful.
	</p>
	<p>
		After we ship the first product written with AutoFixture, I plan to upgrade it to version .9 (beta). That should hopefully happen in the autumn of 2009.
