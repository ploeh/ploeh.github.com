	<p>
		To make it a bit easier to get started with <a href="http://autofixture.codeplex.com/">AutoFixture</a> without having to trawl through all my blog posts, I've added a <a href="http://autofixture.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?title=CheatSheet">Cheat Sheet</a> over at the AutoFixture CodePlex site.
	</p>
	<p>
		As I add more posts on AutoFixture, I'll update the Cheat Sheet with the essentials. Please let me know if you think something's missing.
