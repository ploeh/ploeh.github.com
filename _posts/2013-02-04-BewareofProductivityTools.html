title: "Beware of Productivity Tools"

<div id="post">
	<p>
	<em>This article discusses developer productivity tools.</em>
</p>
<p>
	Once in a while I get into a heated discussion about the merits and demerits of <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/">ReSharper</a>. As these discussions usually happen on Twitter, the 140 character limit isn't conducive to a nuanced debate. That's what I want to start here, not a rant.
</p>
<p>
	This is not going to be an attack on ReSharper. In fact, I don't have a stronger opinion on ReSharper than any other 'productivity tool', but I more often get dragged into discussions about ReSharper than, say, <a href="http://www.telerik.com/products/justcode.aspx">JustCode</a> or <a href="http://www.devexpress.com/Products/Visual_Studio_Add-in/Coding_Assistance/">CodeRush</a>. I guess it's because more people feel passionate about ReSharper.
</p>
<p>
	In fact, I'm going to expand this discussion to a wider range of 'productivity tools', such as (but not limited to)
	</p><ul>
		<li>ReSharper</li>
		<li>JustCode</li>
		<li>CodeRush</li>
		<li><a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/3a96a4dc-ba9c-4589-92c5-640e07332afd">Productivity Power Tools</a></li>
		<li>Visual Studio</li>
	</ul>
<p></p>
<p>
	<strong>Why are we even having this discussion?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	The only 'productivity tool' I currently use is Visual Studio 2012, and even that makes me uneasy. That's just my personal preference, you might say, and there's a partial truth in that. However, I'm not writing this to defend myself. Rather, I'm writing because I think you need to be aware of the issues presented here. It might make you a better developer if I can get you to actively and consciously consider a choice you may have taken for granted.
</p>
<p>
	How do I even get dragged into these Twitter flame fests? Why do people even care whether or not I use a particular 'productivity tool'? First of all, I can't claim myself innocent of <a href="https://twitter.com/ploeh/status/276687083186319360">occasionally trolling</a> - I just get a kick out of yanking that particular chain. There's a reason for that, and it's not just to be mischievous. I want you to reflect on your choice of tools. Don't just drink the Cool Aid.
</p><p>
	Still, there's a deeper, more rational reason why some people care what I do: I do give a lot of presentations about code, and during those presentations I write a lot of code. Whenever I give a talk where I code live, I always rehearse a lot and use specialized code snippets in order not to bore the audience with trivial coding. <a href="http://ndc2011.macsimum.no/mp4/Day3%20Friday/Track7%201500-1600.mp4">Here's an example</a> where during the talk, someone tweeted to complain that I didn't use ReSharper. However, the purpose of giving a talk about code isn't to produce the code in the fastest possible time. The purpose is to <em>teach</em> code. If I code too slowly, the audience may fall asleep, but if I go too fast, no one is going to learn anything. I'm just not convinced that in this particular case, the use of a 'productivity tool' is inherently better.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Can you even live without this or that productivity tool?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	The most common reaction I get whenever people hear that I don't use their favorite 'productivity tool' is one of disbelief.
</p>
<blockquote>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://twitter.com/paulroho/status/276801779230973954">omg why? How can do without #resharper?</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://twitter.com/asbjornu/status/276735101591748608">You're seriously missing out. Visual Studio is completely useless without ReSharper, imho.</a></li>

		<li><a href="https://twitter.com/hmemcpy/status/276678933649453056">I don't understand why you avoid ReSharper.</a></li>

	</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
	What's my beef with productivity tools? It's much deeper than a dislike for any particular tool. <a href="http://www.charlespetzold.com/">Charles Petzold</a> already described his concern about Visual Studio in 2005 in a great talk titled <a href="http://www.charlespetzold.com/etc/doesvisualstudiorotthemind.html">Does Visual Studio Rot the Mind?</a>. It's a long read, but definitely worth your while. You should go read it now.
</p>
<p>
	In case you didn't want to take the time to read that article (but then: you're already reading <em>this</em> lengthy article), here's the gist of it: Via IntelliSense, code generation, Wizards and drag and drop, Visual Studio assists us, but it also pushes us towards writing (or not writing) code in a particular way. It railroads us.
</p>
<p>
	Does it make us more productive? I don't even know how to measure developer productivity, so I can't answer that. Do we <em>learn</em> while coding like that? Not much, I'd say.
</p>
<p>
	While Visual Studio is, in many ways, an impressive and extremely useful piece of software, it also concerns me that I'm so dependent on it. To learn new techniques, I try to follow what's going on outside the .NET/Microsoft ecosystem. <a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a> looks like a very interesting language. <a href="http://www.erlang.org/">Erlang</a> seems to solve some hard problems in an easy way. <a href="http://storm-project.net/">Storm</a> seems to be way ahead of anything Microsoft can currently offer. <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> developers have claimed high productivity for years. <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> is a better source control system than anything Microsoft offers.
</p>
<p>
	However, I feel constrained by my reliance on Visual Studio. I want to learn and use those other technologies as well as .NET, so I'm certainly not looking for tools that will further strengthen my bond with Visual Studio. Using plain vanilla Visual Studio is the least I can do to broaden my horizons.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Productivity boosts</strong>
</p>
<p>
	A common argument for a 'productivity tool' is that it makes you more productive. "<a href="https://twitter.com/sapiensworks/status/276713901314408448">Without #resharper my productivity drops by 50%, I'm amazed that you can manage without it</a>". That's an interesting statement. How do you even measure productivity?
</p>
<p>
	For the sake of argument, let's for a moment pretend that programmer productivity is measured by lines of code written. There's this myth going around that a professional programmer <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/966800/126014">only writes 10 lines of code per day</a>. This is probably not true, but even so, how many lines of code do you produce <em>on average</em> per day? 100? 200? Are you seriously going to claim that <a href="https://twitter.com/sapiensworks/status/276741827141451778">your productivity bottleneck is determined by how fast you can type?</a> Really? Then learn to type faster.
</p>
<p>
	Consider that most code is read a lot more than it's written. Code should be optimized for reading, not writing. Thus, productivity, if it can be measured at all, should be measured by how quickly programmers can read and understand a piece of code - not by how fast it can be written.
</p>
<p>
	Furthermore, if you believe that Pair Programming is one good and productive way to produce software, you must also realize that at every given moment, at least one person isn't typing at all. As Martin Fowler <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/PairProgrammingMisconceptions.html">puts it</a>: "that [Pair-Programming halves the productivity of developers] would be true if the hardest part of programming was typing". In my experience, this is not the case. Thus, I'm not convinced that 'productivity tools' make anyone more productive. 
</p>
<p>
	If you've ever looked beyond the Microsoft echo chamber in the last decade, you will have heard a particularly group of developers boast unmatched productivity. Those would be <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> developers. Lately, it seems to me that many alpha geeks gravitate towards JavaScript (and particularly <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>). And what about <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> or Clojure? In all cases it seems that the reason why cutting edge programmers are leaving .NET, in favor of other languages and platforms, is because of better productivity. What do these languages have in common? Well, the preferred development environment certainly isn't Visual Studio. These programmers 'get by' with <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>, <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>, <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>, and many other editors. Apparently, it's possible to be 'crazy productive' without Visual Studio and a 'productivity tool'.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Railroading</strong>
</p>
<p>
	As Charles Petzold points out in his excellent article, Visual Studio enforces a certain <em>bottom-up</em> style of programming that isn't particularly aligned with business needs. Visual Studio (with or without 'productivity tools') makes it hard (but not impossible) to do <a href="http://pluralsight.com/training/Courses/TableOfContents/outside-in-tdd">Outside-In development</a>.
</p>
<p>
	My feeling is that whenever a tool helps us in a certain way, it closes a lot of other doors on us. We may not even be aware of what we aren't being shown, but if we can shake off the helping hand, we may also be able to see other options.
</p>
<p>
	I don't mind being helped by a tool once in a while, but at other times, I'd rather make an informed decision by myself. At least I think it's important to realize that being helped means that decisions are being made for me. It's <em>not</em> a win-win situation. I may be able to finish a task quickly, but I lose the opportunity to learn. Not only that, but the more I rely on a tool for assistance, the more dependent do I become of it. The're a word for that. It's called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in">Vendor lock-in</a>.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Final thoughts</strong>
</p>
<p>
	All of this is highly subjective and personal. My personal style is to be very deliberate and patient. I go slowly in order to move fast.
</p>
<p>
	In order to demonstrate just how slowly I go, I recorded <a href="http://youtu.be/IfYHrARvTxo">half an hour of a TDD session</a>. There's nothing special about this TDD session. I didn't pick it to impress anyone. I didn't pick the 'best' from a pool of a dozen candidates. I just recorded how I work and uploaded it. I dare you to watch it all the way through. It will be boring. You will see much think time and long periods of inactivity. This is actually a typical depiction of how I work. Yet, somehow, I still manage to produce software in such a quality that people keep coming back to me to pay me to do more.
</p>
<p>
	If you watch just five minutes of that video, it should be clear to you that a 'productivity tool' wouldn't be of any help to me. It might not slow me down either, once I'd learned to use it, but it wouldn't make me more 'productive' either, so why should I bother with it?
</p>
<p>
	This is just <em>my</em> opinion of 'productivity tools.' It's not a one-size-fits-all judgment. If you feel that you benefit from using your favorite 'productivity tool' I'm not going to tell you to change your ways. Likewise, don't judge me because I don't use a particular tool. Some programmers that I really respect use ReSharper. I respect them not because of, but rather despite of, that.

It helped me to see stupid mistakes, like possible Null references etc.<br>
As I get more experienced I rely less on ReSharper and mainly use it out of convenience and I think I could do with out it.</div>

	<div class="comment-content">I like to say that Visual Studio would be an excellent IDE in if it wasn't so bad to write code in, the editor really isn't nearly as good as vim or emacs and there simply is way too much chrome with all the damn sidebars, bottom-bars, top-bars, popup-windows etc. etc.. That is why I use vim or emacs with evilmode whenever I don't have to write .NET.<br>
<br>
I don't use Resharper so much for productivity enhancement but rather to ease the cognitive requirement when navigating a big codebase. The fuzzyfind ability to go to type, symbol or file really makes it a lot easier on the brain because you don't have to remember exactly where to find the particular method that you remember part of the name of. <br>
<br>
Same functionality can of cause be had in vim and emacs but in a much more light-weight approach with small modules doing one thing great. I don't know what it is with Windows and the obsession with big monolithic applications (and tools) compared to unix which is much more about small well-integrated but pluggable modules.</div>

	<div class="comment-content">While I do agree with probably the main part of your concerns, namely &quot;I want you to reflect on your choice of tools. Don't just drink the Cool Aid.&quot;, you argue against productivity tools by using a lot of generalizations.<br>
<br>
You mention it is hard to measure programmer productivity, yet you argue a lot from a very narrow view of programmer productivity, namely lines of code written.<br>
<br>
Productivity boosts<br>
<br>
&quot;Consider that most code is read a lot more than it's written. Code should be optimized for reading, not writing. Thus, productivity, if it can be measured at all, should be measured by how quickly programmers can read and understand a piece of code - not by how fast it can be written.&quot;<br>
<br>
Productivity tools not only focus on writing lines of code, but also aid exactly in faster navigation of the code, and optimized representations. This is exactly what one of the tweeters mentioned: &quot;hmm.. R# is good for navigating around. Shortcuts to follow application flow, up and down. How do you do that without r#?&quot; These features can also be found in Vim/Emacs. I haven't used these text editors myself, but if you read a bit about it they are simplistic, yet very powerful.<br>
<br>
Productivity Power Tools offers vertical tabs, allowing to have more tabs open at once, and even color-coding them. ReSharper allows more fine-grained color coding, e.g. extension methods can be given a different color allowing to more easily identify them. All of these enhancements have nothing to do with writing code.<br>
<br>
Railroading<br>
<br>
I think it's important to differentiate between different types of railroading here. I am not a big fan of &quot;automated processes&quot; either, e.g. code snippets or wizards. They indeed tend to close doors for you, preventing you from making more informed decisions. In fact I argued before code snippets actually promote bad design: http://whathecode.wordpress.com/2010/11/03/why-code-snippets-promote-bad-design/<br>
<br>
But what about the hint system of ReSharper? It makes you aware of potential problems in your code, or alternate approaches. That's what makes it even a good learning tool as Martin commented before, or can just remind you of things you didn't immediately think about (e.g. access to modified closures).<br>
<br>
To summarize, I think in order to have a more honest discussion about productivity tools, you should at least also look into where they can help you, instead of generalizing you don't like them because they have a few particular features you dislike.<br>

	<div class="comment-content">Just a quick comment about developer productivity here, as it relates to your article. I strongly suspect that the &quot;without #resharper my productivity drops by 50% ...&quot; comment has nothing to do with 'lines of code' or 'typing speed', as you imply. Rather, it's a comment on 'how fast can I get my code to look like I want it' (presumably to make the code more readable, understandable, and maintainable). This includes extracting methods, including new methods in interfaces, creating new classes and moving them to new files, referencing and 'using' external libraries, etc. <br>
<br>
All of these things can be tedious to do 'manually', and can be significantly less tedious with a productivity tool like resharper. As long as what *you* want the code to look like matches what *resharper* wants the code to look like, that is.</div>

	<div class="comment-content">I have a great deal of respect for you; I think on this topic, while you make valid points, your conclusion doesn't follow.<br>
<br>
When I worked through the book Seven Languages in Seven Weeks, the lack of IntelliSense was painful. I typically had a reference web page open all the time, and had to keep looking away from the code to look up a function. With experience, the time for this is reduced, but it's not eliminated. I remember the same sort of back-and-forth from my xBase days.<br>
<br>
I've seen you code on Pluralsight (an experience I'd recommend to others). You use the Visual Studio refactoring tools for outside-in development, writing a new method name and having the IDE create the stub. You also use NuGet extensively; I'd call that a major productivity tool.<br>
<br>
Martin Fowler wrote Refactoring thirteen years ago. I got the impression that he hoped much of it would be automated, and this has come to pass; computers are good at repetitive tasks. My IDE can Extract Method more quickly, accurately, and safely than I can.<br>
<br>
ReSharper has more and better refactorings than Visual Studio, in my opinion.<br>
<br>
Navigating complex code bases, including legacy code bases, is an area in which ReSharper shines. Anything that can help me understand the code is a boon.<br>
<br>
I agree that developers have to learn how to do these things by hand. After that, I don't feel that endlessly repeating the same routine tasks is a good use of my or my employer's time.</div>

	<div class="comment-content">You're comparing some sort of abstraction to R# - and I think that's your biggest mistake here. R# does not abstract or hide code at all - in fact, it's quite the opposite. My favorite features of R# are the keyboard shortcuts and code analysis tools. With R# in hand, I can navigate an entire class hierarchy, jump though methods, into (decompiled) methods and even *easily* navigate stack traces that I copied from an external source (such as ASP.net's yellow screen of death). I can do this almost as quickly as I can think, which removes almost all of the friction of the user interface so that it's just me, and _my_ code.<br>
<br>
The code generation of R# isn't the same thing as the code generation for, let's say, a WYSIWYG like Dreamweaver. It's not that R# will tell me &quot;I need a class here&quot; or &quot;this should be a field that is filled in by a ctor parameter.&quot; Instead, if _I_ decide I need a new class, or _I_ decide I want to pull up some public members of a class into an interface, I can do those tasks with a simple keystroke. Sometimes the code generation &quot;hints&quot; get a bit annoying - for example, although I am an avid LINQ user and functional programming fan, there are many times where the readability would suffer if I let R# turn a foreach loop into a single two-thousand character expression. But that choice is still up to me - and the times where R# does suggest I use code that ends up being cleaner than what I had wrote, I take advantage of that.<br>
<br>
So no, R# doesn't hide your code from you, it just removes some of the brain-to-code barrier that is present in all languages. Saying R# is hindering my understanding of code is like saying that you should always use C++ over C# because C# makes you more productive - or it's like suggesting that a digital painter who uses Photoshop and a drawing tablet doesn't still need to understand lighting and materials in the same way that a traditional painter would.<br>
<br>
R# isn't going to make you a better coder, but it will make you faster and make the experience of writing and navigating code much more pleasant.</div>

	<div class="comment-content">Hi Mark,<br>
I'm agree with you that embracing Visual Studio and R# stimulates a sort of addiction that prevent developers to really deepen non-Microsoft technology (in sense of development, because .NET/C# are from long time standardized and can run also on *nix; but this is off-topic).<br>
<br>
The point is that tools (or productivity tools in this case) are neutral. They can be used to enforce theoretically correct techniques or to spread the code with &quot;code smells&quot;.<br>
<br>
So if a developer lacks solid (in all senses, acronym included) basis, he will produce a bad design with any tool he will use.<br>

	<div class="comment-content">Another point to be added here is that .NET is TIED to Visual Studio, there is no way you can write c# outside Visual Studio and microsoft seems to put a lot of effort into this, for instance nuget worked only inside visual studio at the beginning.<br>
<br>
Antoher example is that in almost every other language your project match with a folder.. or some friendly configuration file (package.json whatever), but in .Net you have project files, like csproj which is not human readable/editable.. so you are forced to use this IDE. Visual studio is a gigantic IDE where you can do things like integration tests, managing a database and of course write some code.</div>

	<div class="comment-content">Couldn't agree more. The only extensions that interact with code that I have installed are Productivity Power Tools (with only one or two of its more benign extensions enabled) and GhostDoc.<br>
<br>
People often give me uphill for that; I get where you are coming from.<br>
<br>
ReSharper or most other refactoring tools slow my IDE down to the point where its actually catching up with my typing (except CodeRush, it isn't *too* bad). That's a problem. When I hit a key I had better see it on the monitor, immediately. It has an effect from the 3000 LOC projects I work on here to the 50 000 LOC projects I work on here (to a much larger degree, obviously). Ever wondered why Visual Studio only comes with basic refactorings? Likely because the folks on the Windows team use Visual Studio and anything more elaborate would bog them down too much.<br>
<br>
I work in a VM so just throwing more hardware at the problem won't fix it, and I'll take the productivity boost of VMs over a refactoring tool any day.<br>
<br>
I guess ReSharper is why a lot of people are complaining about how slow VS2012 is, because for most people when they talk about Visual Studio they actually mean Visual Studio + ReSharper. It's probably why I don't have the same problem as them and personally think it's the fastest Visual Studio released; the ReSharper plugin must just be a little new/unoptimised at the moment.</div>

But intellisense is the most wonderful thing ever! <br>
The day this was added, my programming skills increased by a huge step. I could explore and discover all the libraries. A hobby of mine, is now to create empty winforms, add a button, a timer, and just start coding... &quot;Dim foo as System.... Hmm what am I gonna do today...? Let's explore this library..&quot;<br>
Just to say, intellisense made me a better and MUCH faster coder. It's perfect for people like me who will never ever open a paper book again, and would rather learn by doing.</div>

There are some standard to measure our productivity: <br>

<br>
And some tools are able to automatically compute function point based on this standard.<br>

	<div class="comment-content">I've never attempted to use a productivity tool that wasn't the opposite.  I come from a pre-GUI, pre-Visual Studio, pre-Windows, pre-DOS world where programmers had to know where *all* of their files actually were.  Because we not only had to edit them, we had to back them up.  I programmed for Windows 2.x and 3.x without the &quot;convenience&quot; of a symbolic debugger because when compiled with the debug extensions, the code wouldn't fit in the base memory partition (remember those?).  I already knew how to debug without such &quot;convenience&quot;.  More than once I found problems my colleagues were stumped on with old fashioned debugging techniques.  Including bugs in their symbolic debugger.  For the past 10 years I've been more or less forced to use Visual Studio.  At least in the C++ environment I know where it hides most of the definitions.  My single biggest problem with it is accidentally messing up my screen layout and trying to figure out how it happened and how to get it back.  Intellisense works great except when it doesn't.  When I can type faster than my near state-of-the-art computer can file what I just typed, someone is wasting an awful lot of cycles, doing what I can't fathom.  And no one has mentioned Microsoft's absolutely dreadful resource editor.  Oh, the graphic part of it has improved - I used to type my dialog templates directly into the .rc file.  More accurate and faster.  Now I can edit the look, but its ability to botch resource IDs and duplicate them continues to this day, 24 years after I first cursed the Microsoft resource editor.  I am to the point that any time I do much of anything with resources, I manually edit the resource ID file and check it for the duplicates that are sure to exist.  Before my current marriage to Visual Studio, I worked in pure C and Unix for 13 years, using a text editor I wrote myself. In spite of its severe limitations, and paying actual money (hundreds of cups of coffee I'll never see again) for Other People's Editors, I stuck with my own.  Couldn't stand any of them.  Yes, there's something unbeatable about working in your own code base.  Come to think of it, the only productivity tools I ever had that improved MY productivity are the ones I wrote myself.  The idea that a team of geeks thousands of miles away know how I program, or how I ought to program, is laughable.  </div>

	<div class="comment-content">When i started to work, i never knew about productivity tools. I always was dependant on the intellisense of the enviroment i was working on.<br>
<br>
Last year, I was hired on a private software developer company, which used R#, and since then, i have been loving it. But i dont let it be what defines my productivity. I learned a lot from the code snippets and suggestions it makes, and nowadays, i hardly recieve a suggestion from it, i had learnt mostly all of its trick to improve the readability of the code. To this days, i use it mostly to fill in code that we had designed on code snippets from our standards, but we can work withouth it just right<br>
<br>
Another productivity tool that i use along side R# is power tools, mostly for it search and localization of variables along the code. Selecting a variable and pressing ctrl+shit+up/down to navigate through the code is pretty awesome!</div>

	<div class="comment-content">In general I do agree that productivity tools can be a bit over blown.  I've used text editors and IDEs and Visual Studio etc.  The biggest thing I get from ReSharper and other tools on a daily basis is the elimination of repetitive tasks.  Creating a property is easy.  Type prop-tab and the code structure appears.  Then I just have to dive in and do any customization I need.  Do I want to convert the property to one backed by a variable?  That's just a few key strokes away.  Could I do it by typing in almost the same amount of time?  Sure.  I've never felt that I couldn't code without productivity tools but they do make some tasks less tedious.<br>
<br>
As far as learning about the language I'm using, I have to disagree with you there.  I often use Intellisense to find available methods to call on a given object and the documentation on those methods gets displayed so it's convenient for me if I'm working with a framework or portion of .Net I'm unfamiliar with.  I also found ReSharper's ability to refactor loops into Linq code to be very educational when I was starting out with Linq.  It would condense loops to Linq when I couldn't see how to express it and would sometimes highlight methods that I did not realize existed, helping me understand what Linq could do and how to think about using it.<br>
<br>
In the end the basic truth is that your mileage will vary.  What you get out of a tool will depend on how you approach it's use.  Productivity tools can help explore existing code and how it works and it can help you learn how to use unfamiliar frameworks but you have to be thinking about what the tool is doing.</div>

	<div class="comment-content">My take of the subject is... If you can't code properly without them then you shouldn't be using them. You should understand and be able to write what ReSharper is writing for you. <br>
<br>
IMO, the most important &quot;ility&quot; is READABILITY. These productivity tools write the most unreadability code I have ever seen. Your code should be written in a way that a Jr. Developer that knows a different language can read your code (without comments) at 2am half sleep.</div>

	<div class="comment-content">Having only worked the last 8 months (of over 12 years of dev) at a company where ReSharper is basically embedded in the culture, I can say this: I've seen far too many occasions of forced usage of the tool when a person could have just edited the text quicker. Personally, I use ViEmu too, because I'm very used to Vi-style editing and navigation. There's been many times when I could Vi myself to the place I want to be MUCH faster than a colleague with ReSharper.<br>
<br>
All of that being said, now that I have it, there are some conveniences, mainly the renaming stuff (yes, I know VS has that, but I'd really like a dialog that allowed the rename to happen instead of trying to find the fiddly little drop-down; I'm not a fan of ReSharper's inline renamer, largely because it doesn't play well with ViEmu, but I digress), &quot;find all usages&quot; (which is a little more honed than global find, but I still use the latter quite a bit) and &quot;Refactor method&quot; which, I have to admit, /when it gets it right/, can do the job faster than I can. The only problem with that is that I've found it to only be about 80% correct, producing really wonky refactors at other times -- but I can quickly undo and hand-craft as required. A colleague of mine tried to force me to rather re-write parts of code to &quot;help&quot; the refactor to take place -- I'm sure I don't have to point out how little sense that makes in the face of just refactoring by hand.<br>
<br>
And I do use the ReSharper test runner, because Ctrl-U,Ctrl-L is the quickest way I've found to re-run all tests before a checkin. Ctrl-U,Ctrl-R is also well handy for running the current test or fixture (scope dependent), and Ctrl-U,Ctrl-D is a quick way to step into a test with a debugger. I also prefer the ReSharper test runner UI over the NUnit one -- but that's a minor thing, really.<br>
<br>
At the end of the day though, I can quite easily live without these things. I don't think any of these tools are *perfect*, but what is? The parts of ReSharper which work for me shave seconds off of my work day here and there -- and that all adds up, so I appreciate them where then help. But I like to stick to the idea of a tool for a task: if it enhances my work without detracting from it, then it's useful. And if it doesn't work for you, don't use it. I could more easily part with ReSharper than ViEmu, to be totally honest.</div>

	<div class="comment-content">I've been programming since I got my first HP calculator back in 1980.  Assembly code, compilers, Opus make scripts, line editors (even on a printer terminal!!).  Back in the 90's, I used Multi-Edit for writing Clipper apps--what a fantastic macro language it had!!  Now I'm coding mostly in C# with Visual Studio.  I LOVE Intellisense--particularly for showing all the descriptions of the methods and parameters that I write with the /// &quot;self&quot;-documenter.<br>
<br>
I tried Resharper--for about one week. The myriad of options regarding what to flag as &quot;wrong&quot; coding style made my head spin. So I figured I'd use the defaults--BIG mistake.  It seemed everything I was writing was wrong.  I spent more time trying to &quot;fix&quot; (and research) my Resharper-flagged &quot;mistakes&quot; than actually writing real code.  I happily uninstalled it.</div>

	<div class="comment-content">I've been programming for more then 19 years now, in the begining I used the ms-dos text editor, then notepad, dreamweaver, etc...<br>
<br>
It doesn't matter what you use, the problem comes when the editor/IDE does work you dont know about and dont understand well, then you are dependent since it does something you couldnt do without it, I like visual studio very much, especially the debugger and intellisense, but I dont need it to produce quality code, it just helps do things faster. or helps me learn new libraries without going through the reference.<br>
<br>
Ruby and Javascript are different since they are dynamic languages so the need for static typing and reference tracking isnt there as much. but those languages on the other hand are tougher to debug and I have seen a debugger for those languages as good as the visual studio one for .NET<br>

I totally agree with the author. I've tried ReSharper and couple of other &quot;productivity tools&quot;, and found that they just distract me.<br>

<br>
My motto is: if you can deliver, I don't care how you did that. If I want you move my staff somewhere in a specified amount of time, I don't care whether you use a truck, a ferrari, or you did the job on foot. It is really whatever suit to any of us! You are not getting better by hand-made refactoring all the time, rather having a tool do that for you.<br>
<br>
This argument remind me back then, when linux had no decent (if at all) user interface but some people used that just to feel &quot;wizards&quot; :) Writing code is not a static thing. Tools, languages etc evolve. We have to evolve as well. Some will say &quot;I don't use Linq. Looks cheesy and I am an old schooler&quot;, &quot;I don't use .NET. I am a C++ guy that is used to have control of my resources&quot;. As we evolve, arguments evolve. Now, even me am using .net (yes was that guy that wanted to write compact c/c++ code with full control) and here we are talking about... productivity tools! :)<br>
<br>
I do not use any of these tools (apart from VS of course) not because I am a purist. I just haven't ever looked for it. Now that I saw what R# can do, I am really tempted! </div>
