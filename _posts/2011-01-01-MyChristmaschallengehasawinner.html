title: "My Christmas challenge has a winner"

<div id="post">
	<p>A week ago I concluded Microsoft Denmark's 2010 .NET Community Christmas Calendar with a challenge about <a href="/2010/12/24/ChallengeResolveclosedtypeswithMEF">resolving closed types with MEF</a>. As 2011 came around, the deadline ended, so it's now time to pick the winner.</p> <p>I didn't get a lot of entries, which can be interpreted in at least one (or more) of the following ways:</p> <ul> <li>The challenge was too difficult  <li>The challenge wasn't interesting  <li>The prize wasn't attractive  <li>People had other things to do during the holidays</li></ul> <p>Whatever the reason, it made my task of picking a winner that much easier. The best Danish entry came from <a href="http://danielvg.dk/">Daniel Volder Guarnieri</a> who cheated a bit by partially hard-coding the composition of Mayonnaise into the ContainerBuilder. As I wrote in the original challenge, there are many ways to tackle the challenge, and one was to take the unit tests very literally :)</p> <p>However, honorable mention must go to <a href="http://code.dortikum.net/">Boyan Mihaylov</a> who participated just for the honor. He took a more general approach similar to <a href="http://fluentmef.codeplex.com/">Fluent MEF</a>. This involves implementing a completely new <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.componentmodel.composition.primitives.composablepartcatalog.aspx">ComposablePartCatalog</a> with associated <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.componentmodel.composition.primitives.composablepartdefinition.aspx">ComposablePartDefinition</a> and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.componentmodel.composition.primitives.composablepart.aspx">ComposablePart</a> implementations  -  not a trivial undertaking.</p> <p>Kudos to Boyan and congratulations to Daniel. My thanks for your submissions, and a happy new year to all my readers!</p>
