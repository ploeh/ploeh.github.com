        About a year ago, I was contemplating a conference talk I was going to give. Although I later abandoned the idea for other reasons, for a few days I was thinking about using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gartner_hype_cycle">Gartner hype cycle</a> for an animation. What I had in mind would require me to draw the curve in a way that would enable me to zoom in and out. Vector graphics would be much more useful for that job than a bitmap.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
        Along the way, I considered if there was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)">function</a> that would enable me to draw it on the fly. A few web searches revealed the <a href="https://stats.stackexchange.com/">Cross Validated</a> question <a href="https://stats.stackexchange.com/q/268293/397132">Is there a linear/mixture function that can fit the Gartner hype curve?</a> So I wasn't the first person to have that idea, but at the time I found it, the question was effectively dismissed without a proper answer. Off topic, dontcha know?
    </p>
    <p>
        A web search also seems to indicate the existence of a few research papers where people have undertaken this task, but there's not a lot about it. True, the Gartner hype cycle isn't a real function, but it sounds like a relevant exercise in statistics, if one's into that kind of thing.
    </p>
    <p>
        Eventually, for my presentation, I went with another way to illustrate what I wanted to say, so for half I year, I didn't think more about it.

        Recently, however, I was following a course in mathematical analysis of data, and among other things, I learned how to fit a line to data. Not just a straight line, but any degree of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial">polynomial</a>. So I thought that perhaps it'd be an interesting exercise to see if I could fit the hype cycle to some high-degree polynomial - even though I do realize that the hype cycle isn't a real function, and neither does it look like a straight polynomial function.
    </p>
    <p>
        In order to fit a polynomial to the curve, I needed some data, so my first task was to convert an image to a series of data points.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm sure that there are online tools and apps that offer to do that for me, but the whole point of this was that I wanted to learn how to tackle problems like these. It's like <a href="/2020/01/13/on-doing-katas">doing katas</a>. The journey is the goal.
    </p>
    <p>
        This turned out to be an exercise consisting of two phases so distinct that I wrote them in two different languages.

        <li>Fitting a polynomial to a set of points</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        As the articles will reveal, the first part went quite well, while the other was, essentially, a fiasco.

    <p>
        There's not much point in finding a formula for the Gartner hype cycle, but the goal of this exercise was, for me, to tinker with some new techniques to see if I could learn from doing the exercise. And I <em>did</em> learn something.

        In the next articles in this series, I'll go over some of the details.
