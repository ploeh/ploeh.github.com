	</p>
	<p>
		This article series is part of <a href="/2017/10/04/from-design-patterns-to-category-theory">an even larger series of articles about the relationship between design patterns and category theory</a>. In another article series in this big series of articles, you learned about <a href="/2018/03/19/functors-applicatives-and-friends">functors, applicatives, and other types of data containers</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		You may have heard about <em>map-reduce</em> architectures. Much software can be designed around two general types of operations: those that <em>map</em> data, and those that <em>reduce</em> data. A <a href="https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/01/14/functors-are-containers">functor is a container of data</a> that supports structure-preserving maps. Thus, you can think of <a href="/2018/03/22/functors">functors</a> as the general abstraction for map operations (also sometimes called <em>projections</em>). Does a similar universal abstraction exist for operations that reduce data?
	</p>
	<p>
		Yes, that abstraction is called a <em>catamorphism</em>.
	</p>

	<p>
		<em>Catamorphism</em> is an intimidating word, so let's start with an example. You often have a collection of values that you'd like to reduce to a single value. Such a collection can contain arbitrarily complex objects, but I'll keep it simple and start with a collection of numbers:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">new</span>[]&nbsp;{&nbsp;42,&nbsp;1337,&nbsp;2112,&nbsp;90125,&nbsp;5040,&nbsp;7,&nbsp;1984&nbsp;};</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		This particular list of numbers is an array, but that's not important. What comes next works for any <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code>, including arrays. I only chose an array because the C# syntax for array creation is more compact than for other collection types.
	</p>
	<p>
		How do you reduce those seven numbers to a single number? That depends on what you want that number to tell you. One option is to add the numbers together. There's a specific, built-in function for that:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>&gt; <span style="color:blue;">new</span>[]&nbsp;{&nbsp;42,&nbsp;1337,&nbsp;2112,&nbsp;90125,&nbsp;5040,&nbsp;7,&nbsp;1984&nbsp;}.Sum();
100647</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.enumerable.sum">Sum</a> extension method is a one of many built-in functions that enable you to reduce a list of numbers to a single number: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.enumerable.average">Average</a>, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.enumerable.max">Max</a>, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.enumerable.count">Count</a>, and so on.
	</p>
	<p>
		What do you do, though, if you need to reduce many values to one, and there's no existing function for that? What if, for example, you need to add all the numbers using <a href="/2018/07/16/angular-addition-monoid">modulo 360 addition</a>?
	</p>
	<p>
		In that case, you use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.enumerable.aggregate">Aggregate</a>:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>&gt; <span style="color:blue;">new</span>[]&nbsp;{&nbsp;42,&nbsp;1337,&nbsp;2112,&nbsp;90125,&nbsp;5040,&nbsp;7,&nbsp;1984&nbsp;}.Aggregate((x,&nbsp;y)&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;(x&nbsp;+&nbsp;y)&nbsp;%&nbsp;360)
207</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		The way to interpret this result is that the initial array represents a sequence of rotations (measured in degrees), and the result is the final angle after all the rotations have completed.
	</p>
	<p>
		In other (functional) languages, such a 'reduce' operation is called a <em>fold</em>. The metaphor, I suppose, is that you fold multiple values together, two by two.
	</p>
	<p>
		A <em>fold</em> is a catamorphism, but a catamorphism is a more general abstraction. For some data structures, the catamorphism is more powerful than the fold, but for collections, there's no difference.
	</p>
	<p>
		There's one edge case we need to be aware of, though. What if the collection is empty?
	</p>
	<h3 id="65483950f21d453ebe4e8949eac5751f">
		Aggregation of empty containers <a href="#65483950f21d453ebe4e8949eac5751f" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		What happens if you attempt to aggregate an empty collection?
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>&gt; <span style="color:blue;">new</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">int</span>[0].Aggregate((x,&nbsp;y)&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;(x&nbsp;+&nbsp;y)&nbsp;%&nbsp;360)
<span style="color:red;">Sequence contains no elements
  + System.Linq.Enumerable.Aggregate&lt;TSource&gt;(IEnumerable&lt;TSource&gt;, Func&lt;TSource, TSource, TSource&gt;)</span></pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		The <code>Aggregate</code> method throws an exception because it doesn't know how to deal with empty collections. The lambda expression you supply tells the <code>Aggregate</code> method how to combine two values into one. This is, for instance, how <a href="/2017/12/11/semigroups-accumulate">semigroups accumulate</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The lambda expression handles all cases where you have two or more values. If you have only a single value, then that's no problem either:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>&gt; <span style="color:blue;">new</span>[]&nbsp;{&nbsp;1337&nbsp;}.Aggregate((x,&nbsp;y)&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;(x&nbsp;+&nbsp;y)&nbsp;%&nbsp;360)
1337</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		In that case, the lambda expression isn't involved at all, because the single value is simply returned without modification. In this example, this could even be interpreted as being incorrect, since you'd expect the result to be 257 (<code>1337 % 360</code>).
	</p>
	<p>
		It's safer to use the <code>Aggregate</code> overload that takes a <em>seed</em> value:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>&gt; <span style="color:blue;">new</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">int</span>[0].Aggregate(0,&nbsp;(x,&nbsp;y)&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;(x&nbsp;+&nbsp;y)&nbsp;%&nbsp;360)
0</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		Not only does that gracefully handle empty collections, it also gives you a 'better' result for a single value:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>&gt; <span style="color:blue;">new</span>[]&nbsp;{&nbsp;1337&nbsp;}.Aggregate(0,&nbsp;(x,&nbsp;y)&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;(x&nbsp;+&nbsp;y)&nbsp;%&nbsp;360)
257</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		This works better because the method always starts with the <em>seed</em> value, which means that even if there's only a single value (<code>1337</code>), the lambda expression still runs (<code>(0 + 1337) % 360</code>).
	</p>
	<p>
		This overload of <code>Aggregate</code> has a different type, though:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">static</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">TAccumulate</span>&nbsp;Aggregate&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af;">TSource</span>,&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">TAccumulate</span>&gt;(
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">this</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">IEnumerable</span>&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af;">TSource</span>&gt;&nbsp;source,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">TAccumulate</span>&nbsp;seed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Func</span>&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af;">TAccumulate</span>,&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">TSource</span>,&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">TAccumulate</span>&gt;&nbsp;func);</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		Notice that the <code>func</code> doesn't require the accumulator to have the same type as elements from the <code>source</code> collection. This enables you to translate on the fly, so to speak. You can still use binary operations like the above modulo 360 addition, because that just implies that both <code>TSource</code> and <code>TAccumulate</code> are <code>int</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		With this overload, you could, for example, use <a href="/2018/07/16/angular-addition-monoid">the Angle class</a> to perform the work:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>&gt; <span style="color:blue;">new</span>[]&nbsp;{&nbsp;42,&nbsp;1337,&nbsp;2112,&nbsp;90125,&nbsp;5040,&nbsp;7,&nbsp;1984&nbsp;}
. .Aggregate(<span style="color:#2b91af;">Angle</span>.Identity,&nbsp;(a,&nbsp;i)&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;a.Add(<span style="color:#2b91af;">Angle</span>.FromDegrees(i)))
[{ Angle = 207° }]</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		Now the <code>seed</code> argument is <code>Angle.Identity</code>, which implies that <code>TAccumulate</code> is <code>Angle</code>. The <code>source</code> is still a collection of numbers, so <code>TSource</code> is <code>int</code>. Hence, I called the angle <code>a</code> and the integer <code>i</code> in the lambda expression. The output is an <code>Angle</code> object that represents 207°.
	</p>
	<p>
		That <code>Aggregate</code> overload is the catamorphism for collections. It reduces a collection to an object.

	<p>
		Is <em>catamorphism</em> just an intimidating word for <em>aggregate</em>, <em>accumulate</em>, <em>fold</em>, or <em>reduce?</em>
	</p>
	<p>
		It took me a long time to be able to tell the difference, because in many cases, it seems that there's no difference. The purpose of this article series is to make the distinction clearer. In short, a catamorphism is a more general concept.

		For some data structures, such as <a href="/2018/05/24/church-encoded-boolean-values">Boolean values</a>, or <a href="/2018/05/28/church-encoded-natural-numbers">Peano numbers</a>, the catamorphism is all there is; no fold exists. For other data structures, such as <a href="/2018/06/04/church-encoded-maybe">Maybe</a> or collections, the catamorphism and the fold coincide. Still other data structures, such as <a href="/2018/06/11/church-encoded-either">Either</a> and <a href="/2018/08/06/a-tree-functor">trees</a>, support folding, but the fold is based on the catamorphism. For those types, there are operations you can do with the catamorphism that are impossible to implement with the <em>fold</em> function. One example is that a tree's catamorphism enables you to count its leaves; you can't do that with its <em>fold</em> function.

	<p>
		When encountering a word like <em>catamorphism</em>, your reaction might be:
		<blockquote>
			"Catamorphism?! What does that even mean? It's all Greek to me."
		</blockquote>
		Indeed, it's Greek, as is so much of mathematical terminology. The <em>cata</em> prefix means 'down'; lots of words start with <em>cata</em>, like <em>catastrophe</em>, <em>catalogue</em>, <em>catatonia</em>, <em>catacomb</em>, etc.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <em>morph</em> suffix generally means 'shape'. While the <em>cata</em> prefix appears in common words like <em>catastrophe</em>, the <em>morph</em> suffix mostly appears in more academic contexts. Programmers will probably have encountered <em>polymorphism</em> and <em>skeuomorphism</em>, not to mention <a href="/2018/01/08/software-design-isomorphisms">isomorphism</a>. While <em>morphism</em> is heavily used in mathematics, other sciences use the suffix too, like <em>dimorphism</em> in biology.
	</p>
	<p>
		In category theory, a <em>morphism</em> is basically just an arrow that points from one object to another. Think of it as a function.
	</p>
	<p>
		If a morphism is just a function, why don't we just call it that, then? Is it really necessary with this intimidating terminology? Yes and no.
	</p>
	<p>
		If someone had originally figured all of this out in the context of mainstream programming, he or she would probably have used friendlier names, like <em>condense</em>, <em>reduce</em>, <em>fold</em>, and so on. This would have been more encouraging, although <a href="/2017/10/05/monoids-semigroups-and-friends">I'm not sure it would have been better</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		In software architecture we use many overloaded terms. For example, what's a <em>service</em>, or a <em>client?</em> What does <em>tier</em> mean? Is it the same as a <em>layer</em>, or is it something different? What's the <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/library-frameworks">difference between a library and a framework</a>?
	</p>
	<p>
		At least a word like <em>catamorphism</em> is concise. It's not in common use, so isn't overloaded and vague.
	</p>
	<p>
		Another, more pragmatic, concern is that whether you like it or not, the terminology is already established. Mathematicians decided to name the concept <em>catamorphism</em>. While the name may seem intimidating, I prefer to teach concepts like these using established terminology. This means that if my articles are unclear, you can do further research with other resources. That's the benefit of established terminology, whether you like the specific words or not.
	</p>

		You can compose entire applications based on the abstractions of <em>map</em> and <em>reduce</em>. You can see one example of such a system in my <a href="{{ site.production_url }}/functional-architecture-with-fsharp">A Functional Architecture with F#</a> Pluralsight course.
	</p>
	<p>
		The terms <em>map</em> and <em>reduce</em> may, however, not be helpful, because it may not be clear exactly what types of data you can map, and what types you can reduce. One of the most important goals of this overall article series about universal abstractions is to help you identify when such software architectures apply. This is more often that you think.
	</p>
	<p>
		What sort of data can you map? You can map <em>functors</em>. While hardly finite, there's a catalogue of well-known functors, of which I've covered some, but not all. That catalogue contains data containers like <a href="/2018/03/26/the-maybe-functor">Maybe</a>, <a href="/2018/08/06/a-tree-functor">Tree</a>, <a href="/2018/09/10/the-lazy-functor">lazy computations</a>, <a href="/2018/09/24/asynchronous-functors">tasks</a>, and perhaps a score more. The catalogue of (actually useful) functors has, in my experience, a manageable size.
	</p>
	<p>
		Likewise you could ask: What sort of data can you reduce? How do you implement that reduction? Again, there's a compact set of well-known catamorphisms. How do you reduce a collection? You use its catamorphism (which is equal to a fold). How do you reduce a tree? You use its catamorphism. How do you reduce an Either object? You use its catamorphism.
	</p>
	<p>
		When we learn new programming languages, new libraries, new frameworks, we gladly invest time in learning hundreds, if not thousands, of keywords, APIs, extensibility points, and so on. May I offer, for your consideration, that your mental resources are better spent learning only a handful of universal abstractions?

	  <p>
	      My impression is that part of the functional programming style is to avoid function overloading.  Consistent with that is the naming used by Language Ext for these concepts.  In Language Ext, the function with type (in F# notation) <code>seq&lt;'a&gt; -&gt; ('a -&gt; 'a -&gt; 'a) -&gt; 'a</code> is called <a href="https://github.com/louthy/language-ext/blob/master/LanguageExt.Core/DataTypes/List/Lst.Extensions.cs#L599">Reduce</a> and the function with type (in F# notation) <code>seq&lt;'a&gt; -&gt; 'b -&gt; ('b -&gt; 'a -&gt; 'b) -&gt; 'b</code> is called <a href="https://github.com/louthy/language-ext/blob/master/LanguageExt.Core/DataTypes/List/Lst.Extensions.cs#L420">Fold</a>.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	      I don't know the origin of these two names, but I remember the difference by thinking about preparing food.  In cooking, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduction_(cooking)">reduction</a> increases the concentration of a liquid by boiling away some of its water. I think of the returned <code>'a</code> as being a highly concentrated form of the input sequence since every sequence element (and only those elements) was used to create that return value.  In baking, <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Fold-(Baking)">folding</a> is a technique that carefully combines two mixtures into one. This reminds me of how the seed value <code>'b</code> and the sequence of <code>'a</code> are (typically) two different types and are combined by the given function.  They are not perfect analogies, but they work for me.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	      On a related note, <a href="https://github.com/louthy/language-ext/issues/583">I dislike</a> that Reduce returns <code>'a</code> instead of <code>Option<'a></code>.

			<p>
				Tyson, thank you for writing. As you may know, <a href="/dippp">my book</a> liberally employs cooking analogies, but I admit that I've never thought about <em>reduction</em> and <em>fold</em> in that light before. Good analogies, although perhaps a bit <em>strained</em> (pun intended).
			</p>
			<p>
				They do work well, though, for the reasons you give.
				<blockquote>
					"the functional programming style is to avoid function overloading"
				</blockquote>
				As far as I can tell, this has more to do with the combination of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley%E2%80%93Milner_type_system">Hindley–Milner type inference</a> and currying you encounter in Haskell and ML-derived languages than it has to do with functional programming in itself. If I recall correctly, <a href="https://clojure.org">Clojure</a> makes copious use of overloading.
			</p>
			<p>
				The problem with overloading in a language like <a href="https://fsharp.org">F#</a> is that if you imagine that the function you refer to as <code>fold</code> was also called <code>reduce</code>, a partially applied expression like this would be ambiguous:
			</p>
			<p>
				<pre>let foo = reduce xs bar</pre>
			</p>
			<p>
				What is <code>bar</code>, here? If <code>reduce</code> is overloaded, is it a function, or is it a 'seed value'?
			</p>
			<p>
				As far as I can tell, the compiler can't infer that, so instead of compromising on type inference, the languages in question disallow function overloading.
			</p>
			<p>
				Notice, additionally, that F# does allow <em>method</em> overloading, for the part of the language that enables interoperability with the rest of .NET. In that part of the language, type inference rarely works anyway. I'm not an expert in how the F# compiler works, but I've always understood this to indicate that the interop part of F# isn't based on Hindley-Milner. I don't see how it could be, since the .NET/IL type system isn't a Hindley-Milner type system.
			</p>
			<p>
				The <code>reduce</code> function you refer to is, by the way, based on a <a href="/2017/11/27/semigroups">semigroup</a> instance. More specifically, it's simply how <a href="/2017/12/11/semigroups-accumulate">semigroups accumulate</a>. I agree that <code>reduce</code> is partial, and therefore not as pretty as one could wish, but I think a more appropriate solution is to define it on <code>NotEmptyCollection&lt;T&gt;</code>, instead of on <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code>, as shown in <a href="/2017/12/11/semigroups-accumulate">that article</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				In other words, I don't think <code>reduce</code> belongs on <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code> at all. I know it's in both F# and Haskell, but my personal opinion is that it shouldn't be, just like Haskell's <code>head</code> function ought not to exist either...
