		This article is an instalment in <a href="/2018/03/22/functors">an article series about functors</a>. As another article explains, <a href="/2019/01/07/either-bifunctor">Either is a bifunctor</a>. This makes it trivially a functor. As such, this article is mostly a place-holder to fit the spot in the <em>functor table of contents</em>, thereby indicating that Either is a functor.
	</p>
	<p>
		Since Either is a bifunctor, it's actually not one, but two, functors. Many languages, C# included, are best equipped to deal with unambiguous functors. This is also true in <a href="https://haskell.org">Haskell</a>, where <code>Either l r</code> is only a <code>Functor</code> over the right side. Likewise, in C#, you can make <code>IEither&lt;L, R&gt;</code> a functor by implementing <code>Select</code>:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">static</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">IEither</span>&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af;">L</span>,&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">R1</span>&gt;&nbsp;Select&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af;">L</span>,&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">R</span>,&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">R1</span>&gt;(
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">this</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">IEither</span>&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af;">L</span>,&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">R</span>&gt;&nbsp;source,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Func</span>&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af;">R</span>,&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">R1</span>&gt;&nbsp;selector)
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">return</span>&nbsp;source.SelectRight(selector);
}</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		This method simply delegates all implementation to the <code>SelectRight</code> method; it's just <code>SelectRight</code> by another name. It obeys the functor laws, since these are just specializations of the bifunctor laws, and we know that Either is a proper bifunctor.
	</p>
	<p>
		It would have been technically possible to instead implement a <code>Select</code> method by calling <code>SelectLeft</code>, but it seems generally more useful to enable syntactic sugar for mapping over 'happy path' scenarios. This enables you to write projections over operations that can fail.
	</p>
	<p>
		Here's some <em>C# Interactive</em> examples that use the <code>FindWinner</code> helper method from <a href="/2018/06/11/church-encoded-either">the Church-encoded Either article</a>. Imagine that you're collecting votes; you're trying to pick the highest-voted integer, but in reality, you're only interested in seeing if the number is positive or not. Since <code>FindWinner</code> returns <code>IEither&lt;VoteError, T&gt;</code>, and this type is a functor, you can project the right result, while any left result short-circuits the query. First, here's a successful query:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>&gt; <span style="color:blue;">from</span>&nbsp;i&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">in</span>&nbsp;FindWinner(1,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;-3,&nbsp;-1,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;-1,&nbsp;-1)&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">select</span>&nbsp;i&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;0
Right&lt;VoteError, bool&gt;(false)</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		This query succeeds, resulting in a <code>Right</code> object. The contained value is <code>false</code> because the winner of the vote is <code>-1</code>, which isn't a positive number.
	</p>
	<p>
		On the other hand, the following query fails because of a tie.
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>&gt; <span style="color:blue;">from</span>&nbsp;i&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">in</span>&nbsp;FindWinner(1,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;-3,&nbsp;-1,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;-1)&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">select</span>&nbsp;i&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;0
Left&lt;VoteError, bool&gt;(Tie)</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		Because the result is tied on <code>-1</code>, the return value is a <code>Left</code> object containing the <code>VoteError</code> value <code>Tie</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Another source of error is an empty input collection:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>&gt; <span style="color:blue;">from</span>&nbsp;i&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">in</span>&nbsp;FindWinner&lt;<span style="color:blue;">int</span>&gt;()&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">select</span>&nbsp;i&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;0
Left&lt;VoteError, bool&gt;(Empty)</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		This time, the <code>Left</code> object contains the <code>Empty</code> error value, since no winner can be found from an empty collection.
	</p>
	<p>
		While the <code>Select</code> method doesn't implement any behaviour that <code>SelectRight</code> doesn't already afford, it enables you to use C# query syntax, as demonstrated by the above examples.
