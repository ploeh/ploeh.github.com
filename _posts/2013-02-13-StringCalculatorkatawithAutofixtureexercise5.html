	<div class="comment-content">Hello and thanks for this awesome series.<br>
It seems you assume that the int generator always returns non-negative numbers.<br>
Is this true and by design? why?<br>
Thanks</div>

	<div class="comment-content">Integers generated by AutoFixture have, by design, always been positive, although the algorithm has changed during the years.<br>
<br>
In AutoFixture 3, <a href="https://github.com/AutoFixture/AutoFixture/wiki/AutoFixture-3.0-Release-Notes#wiki-random-numbers">numbers are random</a>.<br>
<br>
In AutoFixture 2.2+, <a href="http://megakemp.com/2011/09/06/behavior-changes-in-autofixture-2-2-anonymous-numbers/">all numbers are generated by a strictly monotonically increasing sequence</a>.<br>
<br>
In AutoFixture prior to 2.2, <a href="/2009/04/03/CreatingNumbersWithAutoFixture.aspx">numbers were also generated as a rising sequence, but one sequence per number type</a>.<br>
<br>
Common for all is that they are 'small, positive integers'.</div>
