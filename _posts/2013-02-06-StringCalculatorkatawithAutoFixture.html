	A couple of weeks ago, at the Warm Crocodile conference in Copenhagen, <a href="http://osherove.com/">Roy Osherove</a> and I talked about <a href="https://github.com/AutoFixture/AutoFixture">AutoFixture</a> and his <a href="http://osherove.com/tdd-kata-1/">String Calculator kata</a>, and I decided to do the kata with AutoFixture 3 and make a series of screencasts out of it.
</p>
<p>
	This series makes no particular attempt at explaining what AutoFixture is, so you might want to first acquaint yourself with some basics, such as the theory of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ploeh/archive/2008/11/17/anonymous-variables.aspx">Anonymous Variables</a>, <a href="http://xunitpatterns.com/Derived%20Value.html">Derived Values</a>, <a href="http://xunitpatterns.com/equivalence%20class.html">Equivalence Classes</a>, and <a href="/2009/03/05/ConstrainedNonDeterminism.aspx">Constrained Non-Determinism</a>. It might also be a good idea to understand how <a href="/2010/10/08/AutoDataTheoriesWithAutoFixture.aspx">AutoFixture integrates with xUnit.net</a>.
</p>
<p>
	The following screencasts are available:

	</ol>
<p>
<p>
	As a general note, I didn't focus much on refactoring in this exercise, as I didn't feel the complexity of the solution required it.</p><p>If you like these screencasts, you may also like my <a href="{{ site.production_url }}/pluralsight-home">Pluralsight</a> course <a href="{{ site.production_url }}/outside-in-tdd">Outside-In Test-Driven Development</a>.<br>

			Thank you for these screencasts and for taking the friction out of Unit Testing! I have one question: how can you run all tests so quickly? I also use TestDriven.Net and have a keyboard shortcut attached to <em>Run Tests</em>. However, this command is contextual and only runs the current method / methods of the current class. I'm not aware of a <em>Run all tests</em> command (or something similar). I see you running all tests in the project even when you're outside the test class.

			Hi Cristian, thank you for writing. The way I use <a href="http://testdriven.net">TestDriven.Net</a> is that I have a keyboard shortcut (Shift+Alt+q, simply because that combination was available, and adequately fits my hand) assigned to <em>TestDriven.NET.RunAllTestsInSolution</em>, which Jamie Cansdale courteously added upon my request; I don't exactly remember at which version that command was added, but I'm currently running TestDriven.Net 3.4 Professional build 2808.

			Just installed the latest TestDriven.Net and I also have the <em>RunAllTestsInSolution</em> option now. Thanks! This is very handy.
