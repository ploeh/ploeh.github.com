    In unit testing an important step is to exercise the <a href="http://xunitpatterns.com/SUT.html">SUT</a>. The member you want to invoke is often a method that takes one or more parameters, but in some test cases you don't care about the values of those parameters  -  you just want to invoke the method.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can always make up one or more <a href="http://xunitpatterns.com/Dummy%20Object.html">Dummy</a> parameters and pass them to the method in question, but you could also use one of <a href="http://autofixture.codeplex.com/">AutoFixture</a>'s Do convenience methods. There are several overloads that all take delegates that specify the action in question while providing you with Dummies of any parameters you don't care about.
  </p>
  <p>
    A good example is WPF's <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.input.icommand.aspx">ICommand</a> interface. The most prevalent method is the Execute method that takes a single <em>parameter</em> parameter:
  </p>
  <p>
  	<pre><span style="color: blue">void</span> Execute(<span style="color: blue">object</span> parameter);</pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    Most of the time we don't really care about the parameter because we only care that the command was invoked. However, we still need to supply a value for the parameter when we unit test our ICommand implementations. Obviously, we could just pass in a new System.Object every time, but why not let AutoFixture take care of that for us?
  </p>
  <p>
    (You may think that new'ing up a System.Object is something you can easily do yourself, but imagine other APIs that require much more complex input parameters, and you should begin to see the potential.)
  </p>
  <p>
    Here's a state-based unit test that verifies that the Message property of the MyViewModel class has the correct value after the FooCommand has been invoked:
  </p>
  <p>
  	<pre>[<span style="color: #2b91af">TestMethod</span>]
<span style="color: blue">public</span> <span style="color: blue">void</span> FooWillUpdateMessage()
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: green">// Fixture setup</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue">var</span> fixture = <span style="color: blue">new</span> <span style="color: #2b91af">Fixture</span>();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue">var</span> sut = fixture.CreateAnonymous&lt;<span style="color: #2b91af">MyViewModel</span>&gt;();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: green">// Exercise system</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fixture.Do((<span style="color: blue">object</span> parameter) =&gt; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sut.FooCommand.Execute(parameter));
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: green">// Verify outcome</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: #2b91af">Assert</span>.AreEqual(<span style="color: #a31515">"Foo"</span>, sut.Message, <span style="color: #a31515">"Message"</span>);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: green">// Teardown</span>
}</pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    Notice how the Do method takes an Action&lt;object&gt; to specify the method to invoke. AutoFixture automatically supplies an instance for the <em>parameter</em> parameter using the same engine to create <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ploeh/archive/2008/11/17/anonymous-variables.aspx">Anonymous variables</a> that it uses for everything else.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Do method in question is really a generic method with this signature:
  </p>
  <p>
  	<pre><span style="color: blue">public</span> <span style="color: blue">void</span> Do&lt;T&gt;(<span style="color: #2b91af">Action</span>&lt;T&gt; action);</pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    There are also overloads that take two, three or four input parameters, corresponding to the available Action types available in the BCL.
  </p>
  <p>
    These methods are simply convenience methods that allow you to express your test code more succinctly than you would otherwise have been able to do.
