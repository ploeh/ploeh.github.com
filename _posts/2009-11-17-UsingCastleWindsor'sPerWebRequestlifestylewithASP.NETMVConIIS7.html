title: "Using Castle Windsor's PerWebRequest lifestyle with ASP.NET MVC on IIS7"

{% include JB/setup %}

<div id="post">
	<p>
		When using <a href="http://castleproject.org/container/index.html">Castle Windsor</a> in web applications you would want to register many of your components with a lifestyle that is associated with a single request. This is the purpose of the PerWebRequest lifestyle.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you try that with ASP.NET MVC on IIS7, you are likely to receive the following error message:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			Looks like you forgot to register the http module Castle.MicroKernel.Lifestyle.PerWebRequestLifestyleModule <br>Add '&lt;add name="PerRequestLifestyle" type="Castle.MicroKernel.Lifestyle.PerWebRequestLifestyleModule, Castle.MicroKernel" /&gt;' to the &lt;httpModules&gt; section on your web.config.
		</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		Unfortunately, following the instructions in the error message doesn't help. There's a <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/castle-project-users/browse_thread/thread/d44d96f4b548611e/1c33a54539f8abf7">discussion about this issue</a> on the Castle Project Users forum, but the gist of it is that if you don't need to <em>resolve</em> components during application startup, this shouldn't be an issue, and indeed it isn't  -  it seems to be something else.
	</p>
	<p>
		In my case I seem to have solved the problem by registering the HTTP module in configuration/system.webServer/modules instead of configuration/system.web/httpModules.
	</p>
	<p>
		Although I haven't had the opportunity to dive into the technical details to understand <em>why</em> this works, this seems to solve the problem on both Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008.

	<div class="comment-content">It is because IIS 7 running under Integration Pipeline(the default, and prefered mode) requires all HttpHandlers and HttpModules to be registered under:<br>
<br>
  /configuration/system.webServer/modules <br>
<br>
It ignores the other HttpHandler and HttpModules defined in system.web.<br>
<br>
If you have a website running under IIS6, or you have downgraded your IIS7 to run in &quot;Classic .NET&quot; pipeline mode, that's when you use /configuration/system.web/httpModules - as it's the OLD way of adding them.<br>
<br>
IIS7 will even take your old web.config from IIS6 and 'upgrade it' by adding in the system.webServer/modules and /handlers section, and will copy over the older definitions.  That is, if you use the IIS Manager to upgrade it.  ;)<br>
