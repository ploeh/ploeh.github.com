		<em>Introducing ZeroToNine, a tool for maintaining .NET Assembly versions across multiple files.</em>
	</p>
	<p>
		When working with <a href="http://semver.org">Semantic Versioning</a> in my .NET projects, <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2013/12/10/semantic-versioning-with-continuous-deployment">I prefer to explicitly update the version information in all relevant AssemblyInfo files</a>. However, doing that by hand is quite tedious when you have many AssemblyInfo files, so instead, I rely on an automated tool.
	</p>
	<p>
		For years, I used a PowerShell script, but recently, I decided to start over and write a 'real' tool, deployable via <a href="http://www.nuget.org">NuGet</a>. It's called <a href="https://github.com/ploeh/ZeroToNine">ZeroToNine</a>, is free, and open source. Using it looks like this:
		<pre>Zero29 -i minor</pre>
		This increments the minor version in all AssemblyInfo files in all subdirectories beneath your present working directory.
	</p>
	<p>
		This is great, because it enables me to do a complete pull of a pull request, build it and run all tests, assign a new version, and push it, without ever leaving the command-line. Since I already do all my <a href="http://git-scm.com">Git</a> work in Git Bash, modifying the AssemblyVersion files was the last step I needed to make available from the command line. The main logic is implemented in a library, so if you don't like command-line tools, but would like to build another tool based on ZeroToNine, you can do that too.
	</p>
	<p>
		It's available <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Zero29">via NuGet</a>, and is written in F#.

                	<p>Can you clarify where one would install this when adding the NuGet package to a solution of several projects?</p>
                	<p>Your documentation says that it will update AssemblyInfo files in all subdirectories beneath the present working directory, but I thought that NuGet packages are applied at a project level, not at a solution level. So, wouldn't this mean that I would be running your tool from one of the many project directories, in which only that project's AssemblyInfo file would be affected?</p>
                	<p>I'm sure I'm not grasping something simple, but I'm anxious to incorporate this into my workflow!</p>
