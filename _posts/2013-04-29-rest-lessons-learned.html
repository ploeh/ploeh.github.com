		Last year I spent a good deal of the year designing and implementing a handful of non-trivial REST APIs for a customer of mine. During that process, I learned some small lessons about the design of RESTful systems that I haven't seen described elsewhere, and I want to share these lessons with you.
	</p>
	<p>
		In order to learn the concepts and philosphy behind REST, I think that <a href="http://amzn.to/UIQ4Mc">REST in Practice</a> is a great resource (pun intended), but when it comes to practical guidance, I find the <a href="http://amzn.to/YFnkRg">RESTful Web Services Cookbook</a> invaluable. It's full of useful and concrete tips and tricks for building RESTful APIs, but I don't remember reading about the following lessons, that I had to learn the hard way.
	</p>
	<p>
		There's so much hype and misrepresentation about REST that I have to point out that when I'm talking about REST, I mean full-on, <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html">level 3</a> REST, with resources, verbs, hypermedia controls and the works.
	</p>
	<p>
		Each of these lessons deserves a small article of its own, but here's an overview:

		I hope you find these tips useful.
