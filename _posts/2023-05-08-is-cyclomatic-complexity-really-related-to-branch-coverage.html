        Regular readers of this blog may be used to its confident and opinionated tone. I write that way, not because I'm always convinced that I'm right, but because prose with too many caveats and qualifications tends to bury the message in verbose and circumlocutory ambiguity.
    </p>
    <p>
        This time, however, I write to solicit feedback, and because I'm surprised to the edge of bemusement by a recent experience.

    <p>
        Consider the following code:
    </p>
    <p>
        <pre><span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">static</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">class</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Collatz</span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">var</span>&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#1f377f;">current</span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;n;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#8f08c4;">while</span>&nbsp;(current&nbsp;!=&nbsp;1)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sequence.Add(current);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#8f08c4;">if</span>&nbsp;(current&nbsp;%&nbsp;2&nbsp;==&nbsp;0)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;current&nbsp;=&nbsp;current&nbsp;/&nbsp;2;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#8f08c4;">else</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;current&nbsp;=&nbsp;current&nbsp;*&nbsp;3&nbsp;+&nbsp;1;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sequence.Add(current);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#8f08c4;">return</span>&nbsp;sequence;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
}</pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        As the names imply, the <code>Sequence</code> function calculates the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture">Collatz sequence</a> for a given natural number.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please don't tune out if that sounds mathematical and difficult, because it really isn't. While the Collatz conjecture still evades mathematical proof, the sequence is easy to calculate and understand. Given a number, produce a sequence starting with that number and stop when you arrive at 1. Every new number in the sequence is based on the previous number. If the input is even, divide it by two. If it's odd, multiply it by three and add one. Repeat until you arrive at one.
    </p>
    <p>
        The conjecture is that any natural number will produce a finite sequence. That's the unproven part, but that doesn't concern us. In this article, I'm only interested in the above code, which computes such sequences.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here are few examples:
    </p>
    <p>
        <pre>&gt; Collatz.Sequence(1)
List&lt;<span style="color:blue;">int</span>&gt;(1)&nbsp;{&nbsp;1&nbsp;}
&gt; Collatz.Sequence(2)
List&lt;<span style="color:blue;">int</span>&gt;(2)&nbsp;{&nbsp;2,&nbsp;1&nbsp;}
&gt; Collatz.Sequence(3)
List&lt;<span style="color:blue;">int</span>&gt;(8)&nbsp;{&nbsp;3,&nbsp;10,&nbsp;5,&nbsp;16,&nbsp;8,&nbsp;4,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;1&nbsp;}
&gt; Collatz.Sequence(4)
List&lt;<span style="color:blue;">int</span>&gt;(3)&nbsp;{&nbsp;4,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;1&nbsp;}</pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        While there seems to be a general tendency for the sequence to grow as the input gets larger, that's clearly not a rule. The examples show that the sequence for <code>3</code> is longer than the sequence for <code>4</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        All this, however, just sets the stage. The problem doesn't really have anything to do with Collatz sequences. I only ran into it while working with a Collatz sequence implementation that looked a lot like the above.

        Cyclomatic complexity <a href="#08c0cb2794184e9da8b9f72e6c9ce985">#</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
        What is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity">cyclomatic complexity</a> of the above <code>Sequence</code> function? If you need a reminder of how to count cyclomatic complexity, this is a good opportunity to take a moment to refresh your memory, count the number, and compare it with my answer.
    </p>
    <p>
        Apart from the opportunity for exercise, it was a rhetorical question. The answer is <em>4</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        This means that we'd need <a href="/2019/12/09/put-cyclomatic-complexity-to-good-use">at least four unit test to cover all branches</a>. Right? Right?
    </p>
    <p>
        Okay, let's try.
    </p>
    <h3 id="d10688e0a13241c7b7124a5ce8f063ef">
        Branch coverage <a href="#d10688e0a13241c7b7124a5ce8f063ef">#</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
        Before we start, let's make the ritual <a href="/2015/11/16/code-coverage-is-a-useless-target-measure">denouncement of code coverage as a target metric</a>. The point isn't to reach 100% code coverage as such, but to <a href="/2018/11/12/what-to-test-and-not-to-test">gain confidence that you've added tests that cover whatever is important to you</a>. Also, the best way to do that is usually with TDD, which isn't the situation I'm discussing here.
    </p>
    <p>
        The first branch that we might want to cover is the Guard Clause. This is easily addressed with an <a href="https://xunit.net/">xUnit.net</a> test:
    </p>
    <p>
        <pre>[Fact]
<span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">void</span>&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#74531f;">ThrowOnInvalidInput</span>()
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assert.Throws&lt;ArgumentOutOfRangeException&gt;(()&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;Collatz.Sequence(0));
}</pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        This test calls the <code>Sequence</code> function with <code>0</code>, which (in this context, at least) isn't a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number">natural number</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you measure test coverage (or, in this case, just think it through), there are no surprises yet. One branch is covered, the rest aren't. That's 25%.
    </p>
    <p>
        (If you use the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/testing/unit-testing-code-coverage">free code coverage option for .NET</a>, it will surprisingly tell you that you're only at 16% branch coverage. It deems the cyclomatic complexity of the <code>Sequence</code> function to be 6, not 4, and 1/6 is 16.67%. Why it thinks it's 6 is not entirely clear to me, but Visual Studio agrees with me that the cyclomatic complexity is 4. In this particular case, it doesn't matter anyway. The conclusion that follows remains the same.)
    </p>
    <p>
        Let's add another test case, and perhaps one that gives the algorithm a good exercise.
    </p>
    <p>
        <pre>[Fact]
<span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">void</span>&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#74531f;">Example</span>()
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">var</span>&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#1f377f;">actual</span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;Collatz.Sequence(5);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assert.Equal(<span style="color:blue;">new</span>[]&nbsp;{&nbsp;5,&nbsp;16,&nbsp;8,&nbsp;4,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;1&nbsp;},&nbsp;actual);
}</pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        As expected, the test passes. What's the branch coverage now?
    </p>
    <p>
        Try to think it through instead of relying exclusively on a tool. The algorithm isn't more complicated that you can emulate execution in your head, or perhaps with the assistance of a notepad. How many branches does it execute when the input is <code>5</code>?
    </p>
    <p>
        Branch coverage is now 100%. (Even the <em>dotnet</em> coverage tool agrees, despite its weird cyclomatic complexity value.) All branches are exercised.
    </p>
    <p>
        Two tests produce 100% branch coverage of a function with a cyclomatic complexity of 4.
    </p>
    <h3 id="7a4d9c5fbb8e4e94a52c61990565e38f">
        Surprise <a href="#7a4d9c5fbb8e4e94a52c61990565e38f">#</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
        That's what befuddles me. I thought that cyclomatic complexity and branch coverage were related. I thought, that the number of branches was a good indicator of the number of tests you'd need to cover all branches. I even wrote <a href="/2019/12/09/put-cyclomatic-complexity-to-good-use">an article to that effect</a>, and no-one contradicted me.
    </p>
    <p>
        That, in itself, is no proof of anything, but the notion that the article presents seems to be widely accepted. I never considered it controversial, and the only reason I didn't cite anyone is that this seems to be 'common knowledge'. I wasn't aware of a particular source I could cite.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now, however, it seems that it's wrong. Is it wrong, or am I missing something?
    </p>
    <p>
        To be clear, I completely understand why the above two tests are sufficient to fully cover the function. I also believe that I fully understand why the cyclomatic complexity is 4.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am also painfully aware that the above two tests in no way fully specify the Collatz sequence. That's not the point.
    </p>
    <p>
        The point is that it's possible to cover this function with only two tests, despite the cyclomatic complexity being 4. That surprises me.
    </p>
    <p>
        Is this a known thing?
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm sure it is. I've long since given up discovering anything new in programming.

        Conclusion <a href="#829b5f9b3e9449d1a023d2bacff5b58c">#</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
        I recently encountered a function that performed a Collatz calculation similar to the one I've shown here. It exhibited the same trait, and since it had no Guard Clause, I could fully cover it with a single test case. That function even had a cyclomatic complexity of 6, so you can perhaps imagine my befuddlement.
    </p>
    <p>
        Is it wrong, then, that cyclomatic complexity suggests a minimum number of test cases in order to cover all branches?
    </p>
    <p>
        It seems so, but that's new to me. I don't mind being wrong on occasion. It's usually an opportunity to learn something new. If you have any insights, please <a href="https://github.com/ploeh/ploeh.github.com#comments">leave a comment</a>.

                My first thought is that the code looks like an unrolled recursive function, so perhaps if it's
                refactored into a driver function and a "continuation passing style" it might make the cyclomatic
                complexity match the covering tests.
            </p>
            <p>
                So given the following:
                <pre>public delegate void ResultFunc(IEnumerable&lt;int&gt; result);
public delegate void ContFunc(int n, ResultFunc result, ContFunc cont);

public static void Cont(int n, ResultFunc result, ContFunc cont) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;if (n == 1) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;result(new[] { n });
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return;
&nbsp;&nbsp;}

&nbsp;&nbsp;void Result(IEnumerable&lt;int&gt; list) => result(list.Prepend(n));

&nbsp;&nbsp;if (n % 2 == 0)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cont(n / 2, Result, cont);
&nbsp;&nbsp;else
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cont(n * 3 + 1, Result, cont);
}

public static IReadOnlyCollection&lt;int&gt; Continuation(int n) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;if (n &lt; 1)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException(
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nameof(n),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$"Only natural numbers allowed, but given {n}.");

&nbsp;&nbsp;var output = new List&lt;int&gt;();

&nbsp;&nbsp;void Output(IEnumerable&lt;int&gt; list) => output = list.ToList();

&nbsp;&nbsp;Cont(n, Output, Cont);

&nbsp;&nbsp;return output;
}</pre>
            </p>
            <p>
                I calculate the Cyclomatic complexity of <code>Continuation</code> to be <em>2</em> and <code>Step</code> to be <em>3</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
                And it would seem you need 5 tests to properly cover the code, 3 for <code>Step</code> and 2 for <code>Continuation</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
                But however you write the "n >=1" case for <code>Continuation</code> you will have to cover some of <code>Step</code>.

              There is a relation between cyclomatic complexity and branches to cover, but it's not one of equality, cyclomatic
              complexity is an upper bound for the number of branches. There's a nice example illustrating this in the 
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cyclomatic_complexity#Implications_for_software_testing">Wikipedia
              article on cyclomatic complexity</a> that explains this, as well as the relation with path coverage (for which
              cyclomatic complexity is a lower bound).

                I find cyclomatic complexity to be overly pedantic at times, and you will need four tests if you get really pedantic. 
                First, test the guard clause as you already did. Then, test with 1 in order to test the <pre>while</pre> loop body 
                not being run. Then, test with 2 in order to test that the <pre>while</pre> is executed, but we only hit the <pre>if</pre>
                part of the <pre>if/else</pre>. Finally, test with 3 in order to hit the <pre>else</pre> inside of the <pre>while</pre>. 
                That's four tests where each test is only testing one of the branches (some tests hit more than one branch, but the 
                "extra branch" is already covered by another test). Again, this is being really pedantic and I wouldn't test this 
                function as laid out above (I'd probaby put in the test with 1, since it's an edge case, but otherwise test as you did). 
            </p>
            <p>
                I don't think there's a rigorous relationship between cyclomatic complexity and number of tests. In simple cases, treating
                things as though the relationship exists can be helpful. But once you start having iterrelated branches in a function, 
                things get murky, and you may have to go to pedantic lengths in order to maintain the relationship. The same
                thing goes for code coverage, which can be 100% even though you haven't actually tested all paths through your code if 
                there are multiple branches in the function that depend on each other.

                If we agree to the definition of cyclomatic complexity as the number of independent paths through a section of code, then the number of tests needed to cover that section <strong>must be</strong> the same per definition, <strong>if those tests are also independent</strong>. Independence is crucial here, and is also the main source of confusion. Both the <code>while</code> and <code>if</code> forks depend on the same variable (<code>current</code>), and so they are not independent.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second test you wrote is similarly not independent, as it ends up tracing multiple paths through through <code>if</code>: odd for 5, and even for 16, 8, etc, and so ends up covering all paths. Had you picked 2 instead of 5 for the test, that would have been more independent, as it would not have traced the <code>else</code> path, requiring one additional test.
            </p>
            <p>
                The standard way of computing cyclomatic complexity assumes independence, which simply is not possible in this case.

                Struan, thank you for writing, and please accept my apologies for the time it took me to respond. I agree with your calculations of cyclomatic complexity of your refactored code.
            </p>
            <p>
                I agree with what you write, but you can't write a sentence like "however you write the "n >=1" case for [...] you will have to cover some of [..]" and expect me to just ignore it. To be clear, I agree with you in the particular case of the methods you provided, but you inspired me to refactor my code with that rule as a specific constraint. You can see the results in my new article <a href="/2023/06/12/collatz-sequences-by-function-composition">Collatz sequences by function composition</a>.

                Jeroen, thank you for writing, and please accept my apologies for the time it took me to respond. I should have read that Wikipedia article more closely, instead of just linking to it.
            </p>
            <p>
                What still puzzles me is that I've been aware of, and actively used, cyclomatic complexity for more than a decade, and this distinction has never come up, and no-one has called me out on it.
            </p>
            <p>
                As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Cunningham#%22Cunningham's_Law%22">Cunningham's law</a> says, <em>the best way to get the right answer on the Internet is not to ask a question; it's to post the wrong answer.</em> Even so, I posted <a href="/2019/12/09/put-cyclomatic-complexity-to-good-use">Put cyclomatic complexity to good use</a> in 2019, and no-one contradicted it.
            </p>
            <p>
                I don't mention this as an argument that I'm right. Obviously, I was wrong, but no-one told me. Have I had something in my teeth all these years, too?

                Brett, thank you for writing, and please accept my apologies for the time it took me to respond. I suppose that I failed to make my overall motivation clear. When doing proper test-driven development (TDD), one doesn't need cyclomatic complexity in order to think about coverage. When following the <a href="/2019/10/21/a-red-green-refactor-checklist">red-green-refactor checklist</a>, you only add enough code to pass all tests. With that process, cyclomatic complexity is rarely useful, and I tend to ignore it.
            </p>
            <p>
                I do, however, often coach programmers in unit testing and TDD, and people new to the technique often struggle with basics. They add too much code, instead of the simplest thing that could possibly work, or they can't think of a good next test case to write.
            </p>
            <p>
                When teaching TDD I sometimes suggest cyclomatic complexity as a metric to help decision-making. <em>Did we add more code to the System Under Test than warranted by tests? Is it okay to forgo writing a test of a one-liner with cyclomatic complexity of one?</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                The metric is also useful in hybrid scenarios where you already have production code, and now you want to add <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characterization_test">characterisation tests</a>: Which test cases should you <em>at least</em> write?
            </p>
            <p>
                Another way to answer such questions is to run a code-coverage tool, but that often takes time. I find it useful to teach people about cyclomatic complexity, because it's a lightweight heuristic always at hand.
            </p>

                Nikola, thank you for writing. The emphasis on independence is useful; I used compatible thinking in my new article <a href="/2023/06/12/collatz-sequences-by-function-composition">Collatz sequences by function composition</a>. By now, including the other comments to this article, it seems that we've been able to cover the problem better, and I, at least, feel that I've learned something.
            </p>
            <p>
                I don't think, however, that the standard way of computing cyclomatic complexity assumes independence. You can easily compute the cyclomatic complexity of the above <code>Sequence</code> function, even though its branches aren't independent. Tooling such as Visual Studio seems to agree with me.
