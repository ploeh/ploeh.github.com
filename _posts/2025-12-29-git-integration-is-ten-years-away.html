        Although, as I've <a href="/2023/07/24/is-software-getting-worse">described earlier</a>, I tend to be conservative about updating my laptop, I tend to make exceptions for <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/">Visual Studio</a> and <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>. I was recently perusing the "what's new" notes after updating one or the other, and among all the new AI capabilities that I'm not interested in, I noticed something else: 'improved Git integration.'
    </p>
    <p>
        As I reflected on that, a thought occurred to me. It seems to me that I've seen these update notes for at least a decade. Improved Git integration.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm not even exaggerating. Git support for Visual Studio was <a href="https://www.hanselman.com/blog/git-support-for-visual-studio-git-tfs-and-vs-put-into-context">announced in 2013</a>. It has, indeed, been around for a long time, and I've been blissfully ignoring it throughout. Even so, it struck me when reading release notes in 2025, that the product in question had improved Git integration.
    </p>
    <p>
        Is it not done yet?
    </p>
    <p>
        Apparently not.
    </p>
    <p>
        It wasn't done ten years ago? Is there any reason to believe that it's done now? Or are we witnessing some reverse <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect">Lindy effect</a>? The longer something has been in development, the longer you may expect it to be in development yet?

        Sarcasm aside, you don't need Git integration in your development environment. Do yourself a favour and learn the <a href="/2024/05/20/fundamentals">fundamentals</a> of Git. It takes a few hours to learn the basics, a few days to become more comfortable with it, but from then, no 'integration' need hold you back. You don't have to wait for the next update. <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/12/19/use-git-tactically/">Use Git tactically</a> today.
