	<p>Since I announced <a href="http://autofixture.codeplex.com/">AutoFixture</a> 2.1 beta 1 no issues have been reported, so I've now promoted the release to the official 2.1 release. This means that if you already downloaded AutoFixture 2.1 beta 1, you already have the 2.1 binaries. If not, you can head over to the <a href="http://autofixture.codeplex.com/releases/view/64686">release page</a> to get it.</p> <p>The NuGet packages will soon be available.</p> <p><strong>Update</strong> (2011.5.4): The NuGet packages are now available.</p>
