		According to the definition of <a href="http://semver.org">Semantic Versioning</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ploeh/Hyprlinkr">Hyprlinkr</a> has been in pre-release in more than a year. With the release of <a href="http://www.asp.net/web-api">ASP.NET Web API</a> 2, I thought it was a good occasion to look at a proper release version.
	</p>
	<p>
		I've tested Hyprlinkr against Web API 2, and apart from some required assembly redirects, it passes all tests against Web API 2 as well as Web API 1. Being able to support both Web API 1 and 2 is important, I think, because not everyone will be able to migrate to Web API 2 right away.
	</p>
	<p>
		Since Hyprlinkr is finally out of pre-release mode, it also means that no breaking changes will be introduced before Hyprlinkr 2, which isn't even on the drawing board yet. Since this constitutes a contract, I also trimmed down the API a bit before releasing Hyprlinkr 1.0.0, but all the essential methods are still available.
