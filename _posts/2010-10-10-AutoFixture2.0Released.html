	<p>It gives me great pleasure to announce the release of <a href="http://autofixture.codeplex.com/">AutoFixture</a> 2.0. This release fixes a few minor issues since <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2010/08/09/AutoFixture20Beta1.aspx">beta 1</a>, but apart from that there are no significant changes.</p> <p>This is a major release compared to AutoFixture 1.1, featuring a completely new kernel, as well as new features and extensibility points. The <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2010/08/09/AutoFixture20Beta1.aspx">beta 1 announcement sums up the changes</a>. Get it <a href="http://autofixture.codeplex.com/releases/view/48806">here</a>.</p>
