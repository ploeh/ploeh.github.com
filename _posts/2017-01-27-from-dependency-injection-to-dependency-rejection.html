	<p>
		Several years ago, I wrote a book called <a href="http://amzn.to/12p90MG">Dependency Injection in .NET</a>, which was published in 2011. The book contains examples in C#, but since then I've increasingly become interested in functional programming to the extend that I now consider F# my primary language.
	</p>
	<p>
		With that combination, it's no wonder that people often ask me how to do dependency injection in functional programming.
	</p>
	<p>
		I've seen more than one answer, from other people, explaining how partial function application is equivalent to dependency injection. In a small series of articles, I'll explain both why this is true, but also why it's <em>not functional</em>. I'll conclude by showing a functional alternative to decoupling logic and (side) effects.

	<p>
		There's another school of functional programmers who believe that dependency injection in functional programming involves a Free monad.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can often make do with less, though.
	</p>
	<p>
		In my experience, it's usually enough to refactor a unit to take only direct input and output, and then compose an <a href="/2020/03/02/impureim-sandwich">impure/pure/impure 'sandwich'</a>. You'll see an example later.

			<li><a href="/2017/01/27/dependency-injection-is-passing-an-argument">Dependency injection is passing an argument</a></li>
			<li><a href="/2017/01/30/partial-application-is-dependency-injection">Partial application is dependency injection</a></li>
			<li><a href="/2017/02/02/dependency-rejection">Dependency rejection</a></li>
			<li><a href="/2017/07/10/pure-interactions">Pure interactions</a></li>
		</ol>
		The first three articles revolve around a common example, which is one of my favourite scenarios: on-line restaurant reservation. You can see an actual example client in my <a href="{{ site.production_url }}/functional-architecture-with-fsharp">Functional Architecture with F#</a> Pluralsight course. The (somewhat dated) client source code is <a href="https://github.com/ploeh/booking-web-ui">available on GitHub</a>. The server-side F# and Haskell example code for this article series is <a href="https://github.com/ploeh/dependency-rejection-samples">available on GitHub</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The scenario is to implement an HTTP-based API that can accept incoming JSON documents that represent restaurant reservations.
	</p>
	<p>
		The fourth article on <em>pure interactions</em> is a gateway to another article series on free monads.
	</p>
	<p>
		I should point out that nowhere in this article series do I reject dependency injection as a set of object-oriented patterns. In object-oriented programming, dependency injection is a well-known and comprehensively described way to achieve decoupling and testability. In the next article, you'll see a brief review of dependency injection in C#.
