<div id="post">
	<p align="left">My latest MSDN Magazine article, this time about CQRS on Windows Azure, is now <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/gg983487.aspx">available at the April MSDN Magazine web site</a>.</p> <p align="left">It's mostly meant as an introduction to CQRS as well as containing some tips and tricks that are specific to applying CQRS on Windows Azure.</p> <p>As an added bonus the code sample download contains lots of idiomatic unit tests written with <a href="http://autofixture.codeplex.com/">AutoFixture</a>'s <a href="/2010/10/08/AutoDataTheorieswithAutoFixture">xUnit.net extensions</a>, so if you'd like to see the result of my TDD work with AutoFixture, there's a complete code base to look at there.</p>

	<div class="comment-content">Really enjoying the article, Mark. I was racking my brain at lunch thinking about some of these issues, regarding safe modification of state, etc. Then, I found the article.<br>
<br>
I may end up doing things with Node and Redis, but still wanting to learn how to do things with Azure.</div>
