	<p><a href="http://autofixture.codeplex.com/">AutoFixture</a> 1.0 Release Candidate 2 is now available on the CodePlex site! Compared to Release Candidate 1 there are very few changes, but the test period uncovered the need for a few extra methods on a recent addition to the library. RC2 contains these additional methods.</p> <p>This resets the clock for the Release Candidate trial period. Key users have a chance to veto this release until a week from now. If no-one complains within that period, we will promote RC2 to version 1.0.</p> <p>The <a href="http://autofixture.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=39161">RC2 release page</a> has more details about this particular release.</p>
