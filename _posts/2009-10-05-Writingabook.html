	<p>For the last few months I've been writing a book for Manning tentatively titled <em>Dependency Injection in .NET</em>. The <a href="http://www.manning.com/seemann/">page about the book</a> is now live at the <a href="http://www.manning.com/">Manning</a> web site where you can read more about it and, if you would like, purchase an Early Access edition and read the chapters as they are being written.</p> <p>If you have ever wanted to learn about Dependency Injection (DI) related to .NET, here's your chance!</p> <p>At the moment I'm about a third of the way into the book, so there's still some way to go, but I hope to be done with it in 2010.</p> <p>If you decide to purchase an Early Access edition, I'd love to receive your feedback in the online forum.</p>

	<div class="comment-content">Ohh, I could have used this book weeks ago! I've been trying to wrap my head around DI/IoC for some time, and in fact am working on a blog post on the subject. It seems complex on the surface, but is less so once you really get into it!<br>
<br>
Purchased the MEAP, looking forward to the results!</div>

	<div class="comment-content">I hope that you get a lot out of it! If parts of the contents strike you as odd or you think that something is missing, please let me know. The <a href="http://www.manning-sandbox.com/forum.jspa?forumID=607">Author Online</a> forum is the preferred place, but you can drop me a line in any way you prefer.</div>

	<div class="comment-content">Hey Mark,<br>
<br>
Got the MEAP of your book and am enjoying it. I was wondering if you are going to make any of the sample code from the book available? That would be awesome.<br>
<br>
thanks,<br>
Bill</div>

	<div class="comment-content">Yes, that is definitely the plan. Manning does have the code, but I don't know when they plan on making it available. It's still a little rough around the edges, but if you would like to get it now, send me an email (use the small envelope icon in the Contact section area) and I'll zip it up for you.</div>
