		<em>Yet another reflection on the relationship between types and tests, this time with a simple example.</em>
	</p>
	<p>
		The debate about dynamic typing versus static typing still goes on. If it ever gets resolved, I suppose it'll be in the far future. Until then, one's position is bound to be determined mostly by experience and belief. I openly admit that I prefer statically typed languages like <a href="http://fsharp.org">F#</a> and <a href="https://www.haskell.org">Haskell</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		As I've <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2016/02/10/types-properties-software">previously touched on</a>, I can't help seeing types as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slider_(computing)">slider</a>. The more to the right you pull it, the stronger the type system. The more to the left you pull it, the more you'll need automated tests to give you a sense of confidence in your code.
	</p>
	<p>
		In this article, I'll share an small revelation recently given to me.

	<p>
		Somewhere, a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a> user was going through <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/H-99:_Ninety-Nine_Haskell_Problems">Ninety-Nine Haskell Problems</a>, and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/46791466/126014">asked how to unit test problem 23</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The problem is elementary:
		<blockquote>
			<a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/99_questions/21_to_28">"Extract a given number of randomly selected elements from a list."</a>
		</blockquote>
		Here's an example of the intended use:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>Î»&gt; rndSelect "abcdefgh" 3
"fag"</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		The first argument to <code>rndSelect</code> is the candidates from which to pick elements; in this case the letters <em>a</em> to <em>h</em>. The second argument is the number of values to select; in this case the number <em>3</em>.

	</h3>
	<p>
		How does one test a function like that? Clearly, when randomness is involved, you'll need some way to regulate the randomness in order to <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/nonDeterminism.html">make tests deterministic</a>. With my blinders on, I assumed that this was the main problem, so I answered with the following plan for a few properties:
		<ul>
			<li>The length of the returned list should be equal to the input length.</li>
			<li>All elements in the returned list should be elements of the list of candidates.</li>
		</ul>
		In addition, I also suggested a way to make tests deterministic, but I'll get back to that later.
	</p>
	<p>
		In response to this plan, the user <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/3234959">chi</a> commented on my second suggestion:
		<blockquote>
			"I think this it is a consequence of the free theorem. If so, no need to test for that!"
		</blockquote>
		Sometimes, I find it difficult to shake my object-oriented TDD-influenced way of thinking, but <em>chi</em> is right. Here's why:

		Parametric polymorphism <a href="#1b301d9910e3472c9039094e6e737d91" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		.NET, including C# and F#, has a platform feature called <em>generics</em>. Haskell has generics as well, although normally, that language feature is called <em>parametric polymorphism</em>. What I had in mind was a set of parametrically polymorphic functions with these types:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:#2b91af;">rndGenSelect</span>&nbsp;::&nbsp;(<span style="color:blue;">RandomGen</span>&nbsp;g,&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">Integral</span>&nbsp;i)&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">=&gt;</span>&nbsp;g&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">-&gt;</span>&nbsp;[a]&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">-&gt;</span>&nbsp;i&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">-&gt;</span>&nbsp;[a]

<span style="color:#2b91af;">rndSelect</span>&nbsp;::&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">Integral</span>&nbsp;i&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">=&gt;</span>&nbsp;[a]&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">-&gt;</span>&nbsp;i&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">-&gt;</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">IO</span>&nbsp;[a]</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		Notice that both functions return lists of <code>a</code> values, where <code>a</code> is a type variable (in C#, you'd call it a <em>generic type argument</em>). It could be <code>Integer</code>, <code>String</code>, <code>Day</code>, or a custom domain type you'd added to the code base two minutes earlier.
	</p>
	<p>
		Given a completely unrestricted type variable, Haskell has no way of creating values. How could it, logically?
	</p>
	<p>
		In C#, you can write <code>default(T)</code>, which tends to mostly produce null references. Haskell doesn't have null, so with that option cut off, how would it be able to produce values of arbitrary types? It can't.
	</p>
	<p>
		When returning a list of <code>a</code> values, the only option open to a parametric polymorphic function is to pick values from its input arguments. For both <code>rndGenSelect</code> and <code>rndSelect</code>, there's only a single source of <code>a</code> values, so there's no reason to test that the functions return values from those lists of candidates. It's the only thing it can do. That's the <em>free theorem</em> for that function.
	</p>
	<p>
		It'd been an entirely different story if the function had concrete types. If, for example, the function had the type <code>RandomGen g =&gt; g -&gt; String -&gt; Int -&gt; String</code>, I could have written a function like this one:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:#2b91af;">rndGenSelect&#39;</span>&nbsp;::&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">RandomGen</span>&nbsp;g&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">=&gt;</span>&nbsp;g&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">-&gt;</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">String</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">-&gt;</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Int</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">-&gt;</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">String</span>
rndGenSelect&#39;&nbsp;_&nbsp;_&nbsp;count&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">replicate</span>&nbsp;count&nbsp;<span style="color:#a31515;">&#39;s&#39;</span>
</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		Because the type of elements is known at compile-time, we can pick an arbitrary <code>Char</code> value (<code>'s'</code>). This is possible because we know the type, and therefore can come up with a strategy to hard-code known values of that type. When the type argument is unknown, this is no longer possible. To paraphrase <a href="http://thecleancoder.blogspot.dk/2010/11/craftsman-63-specifics-and-generics.html">Robert C. Martin</a>, <em>as the types get more generic, the tests become more redundant</em>.

	</h3>
	<p>
		Before we look at automated testing, let's consider how to turn randomness into deterministic behaviour. This is (seemingly) always a problem with unit testing when the desired behaviour contains randomness, because tests should be deterministic. Once again, however, it turns out that <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2015/05/07/functional-design-is-intrinsically-testable">functional design is intrinsically testable</a>. Since Haskell design favours <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function">pure functions</a>, the core of <code>System.Random</code> is deterministic.
	</p>
	<p>
		This is, in fact, not much different from C#, where <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.random">the Random class</a> encapsulates an algorithm that computes a series of random-looking values based on an initial seed value. If you give it the same seed, it'll produce the same sequence of random-looking numbers. Haskell works the same way.
	</p>
	<p>
		This led me to a design with a 'core' function that does all the work, and a 'wrapper' function that only adds one extra feature: randomness.
	</p>
	<p>
		Starting my design with types, I wanted a function with this type:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:#2b91af;">rndGenSelect</span>&nbsp;::&nbsp;(<span style="color:blue;">RandomGen</span>&nbsp;g,&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">Integral</span>&nbsp;i)&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">=&gt;</span>&nbsp;g&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">-&gt;</span>&nbsp;[a]&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">-&gt;</span>&nbsp;i&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">-&gt;</span>&nbsp;[a]
</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		This is the type that I've already discussed above. Because of the free theorem, we already know that the returned list can only contain values selected from the input list. In other words, there's no need to test for that.
	</p>
	<p>
		This function takes a <code>RandomGen</code> argument, which is a type class of pure functions. <code>RandomGen</code> itself is pure; the source of randomness comes from how it's produced. More on that later. This, however, should enable me to write deterministic tests.
	</p>

		Properties <a href="#47f98962da4c42beb96e32d2e1ec92ad" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		Before we start adding deterministic tests, let's see how far we can get with property-based testing. First, designing with types, I need to implement the function so that it compiles. This is the simplest implementation I could think of:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:#2b91af;">rndGenSelect</span>&nbsp;::&nbsp;(<span style="color:blue;">RandomGen</span>&nbsp;g,&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">Integral</span>&nbsp;i)&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">=&gt;</span>&nbsp;g&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">-&gt;</span>&nbsp;[a]&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">-&gt;</span>&nbsp;i&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">-&gt;</span>&nbsp;[a]
rndGenSelect&nbsp;_&nbsp;xs&nbsp;_&nbsp;=&nbsp;[<span style="color:blue;">head</span>&nbsp;xs]
</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		This implementation is both incorrect and unsafe, but it compiles. In TDD fashion, then, I found it appropriate to add a test - in this case a <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck">QuickCheck</a> property:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:#2b91af;">lenProp</span>&nbsp;::&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">Integral</span>&nbsp;i&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">=&gt;</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Int</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">-&gt;</span>&nbsp;[a]&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">-&gt;</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">NonNegative</span>&nbsp;i&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">-&gt;</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Bool</span>
lenProp&nbsp;seed&nbsp;xs&nbsp;(NonNegative&nbsp;i)&nbsp;=
&nbsp;&nbsp;i&nbsp;==&nbsp;genericLength&nbsp;(rndGenSelect&nbsp;(mkStdGen&nbsp;seed)&nbsp;xs&nbsp;i)
</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		This little piece of test code is the only surviving property from my original test plan. It states that for any non-negative count, the list returned from <code>rndGenSelect</code> should have the requested length.
	</p>
	<p>
		Writing this property, however, quickly forced me to deal with the case where the count is negative. It's easy to forget about edge cases when your function is nothing but a pie in the sky, but QuickCheck (and property-based testing in general) is really effective at grounding you in reality. Even with a language like Haskell, I still find the fast feedback loop from tests helpful.
	</p>
	<p>
		The original exercise specification doesn't mention what should happen if the count is negative, so after short deliberation, I decide to write another property:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:#2b91af;">negLenProp</span>&nbsp;::&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">Integral</span>&nbsp;i&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">=&gt;</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Int</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">-&gt;</span>&nbsp;[a]&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">-&gt;</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">Positive</span>&nbsp;i&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">-&gt;</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Bool</span>
negLenProp&nbsp;seed&nbsp;xs&nbsp;(Positive&nbsp;i)&nbsp;=
&nbsp;&nbsp;0&nbsp;==&nbsp;genericLength&nbsp;(rndGenSelect&nbsp;(mkStdGen&nbsp;seed)&nbsp;xs&nbsp;(-i))
</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		This property simply states that for all negative counts, the returned list should be empty.
	</p>
	<p>
		Both of these properties obviously fail, because of the incorrect implementation.
	</p>
	<p>
		The simplest implementation I could think of that passes both properties is this:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:#2b91af;">rndGenSelect</span>&nbsp;::&nbsp;(<span style="color:blue;">RandomGen</span>&nbsp;g,&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">Integral</span>&nbsp;i)&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">=&gt;</span>&nbsp;g&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">-&gt;</span>&nbsp;[a]&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">-&gt;</span>&nbsp;i&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">-&gt;</span>&nbsp;[a]
rndGenSelect&nbsp;_&nbsp;xs&nbsp;count&nbsp;=&nbsp;genericReplicate&nbsp;count&nbsp;(<span style="color:blue;">head</span>&nbsp;xs)
</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		At this point, I don't see how TDD or property-based testing can help me move forward. The remaining work required is to add randomness to the mix. In this case, I'll need to use the <code>RandomGen</code> argument to produce random values, but since I don't know how its algorithm works, then even if I had a seed value known at compile-time, I wouldn't be able to predict which values it'd produce.
	</p>

	</h3>
	<p>
		I admit that I don't know how to write the next test a priori. I do know, however, that if I implement what's missing, I have a deterministic function, and I can use it to write regression test. In other words, I'll reverse direction and write the code first, and then the test. What a novel idea.
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:#2b91af;">rndGenSelect</span>&nbsp;::&nbsp;(<span style="color:blue;">RandomGen</span>&nbsp;g,&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">Integral</span>&nbsp;i)&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">=&gt;</span>&nbsp;g&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">-&gt;</span>&nbsp;[a]&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">-&gt;</span>&nbsp;i&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">-&gt;</span>&nbsp;[a]
rndGenSelect&nbsp;rnd&nbsp;xs&nbsp;count&nbsp;=
&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">let</span>&nbsp;indices&nbsp;=&nbsp;genericTake&nbsp;count&nbsp;$&nbsp;randomRs&nbsp;(0,&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">length</span>&nbsp;xs&nbsp;-&nbsp;1)&nbsp;rnd
&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">in</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">fmap</span>&nbsp;(xs&nbsp;!!)&nbsp;indices
</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		This function first uses <code>randomRs</code> to produce an infinite list of values. These values are indices because they all fall between <code>0</code> and <code>length xs - 1</code>. In other words, they are indices into <code>xs</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		While the list is infinite, it's lazily evaluated, so infinity itself isn't a problem. We only need <code>count</code> elements, though, so we can simply take the first <code>count</code> elements.
	</p>
	<p>
		Finally, the function maps over the list of indices, and for each index value, selects the element at that position.
	</p>
	<p>
		I could inline <code>indices</code> in the return expression, like this:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:#2b91af;">rndGenSelect</span>&nbsp;::&nbsp;(<span style="color:blue;">RandomGen</span>&nbsp;g,&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">Integral</span>&nbsp;i)&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">=&gt;</span>&nbsp;g&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">-&gt;</span>&nbsp;[a]&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">-&gt;</span>&nbsp;i&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">-&gt;</span>&nbsp;[a]
rndGenSelect&nbsp;rnd&nbsp;xs&nbsp;count&nbsp;=
&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">fmap</span>&nbsp;(xs&nbsp;!!)&nbsp;$&nbsp;genericTake&nbsp;count&nbsp;$&nbsp;randomRs&nbsp;(0,&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">length</span>&nbsp;xs&nbsp;-&nbsp;1)&nbsp;rnd
</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		I find that more obscure than the first alternative, though, but both versions pass the properties and do what they're supposed to do.
	</p>

	</h3>
	<p>
		How do I know that my code works? Well, that's always difficult with code that contains randomness, but you can load the function into GHCi and perform some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanity_check">sanity testing</a>:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>Î»&gt; rndGenSelect (mkStdGen 42) "foo" 3
"ofo"
Î»&gt; rndGenSelect (mkStdGen 1337) "bar" 10
"rabbaarrra"
Î»&gt; rndGenSelect (mkStdGen (-197221)) ['a'..'z'] 5
"ntfnc"</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		That looks, I suppose, random enough... What's more important is that this is completely repeatable. This means that I can write <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2018/04/30/parametrised-unit-tests-in-haskell">parametrised tests</a> that protect against regressions:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:#a31515;">&quot;rndGenSelect&nbsp;of&nbsp;chars&nbsp;returns&nbsp;correct&nbsp;result&quot;</span>&nbsp;~:&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">do</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(seed,&nbsp;xs,&nbsp;count,&nbsp;expected)&nbsp;&lt;-
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;42,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#a31515;">&quot;foo&quot;</span>,&nbsp;&nbsp;3,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#a31515;">&quot;ofo&quot;</span>),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1337,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#a31515;">&quot;bar&quot;</span>,&nbsp;10,&nbsp;<span style="color:#a31515;">&quot;rabbaarrra&quot;</span>),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(-197221,&nbsp;[<span style="color:#a31515;">&#39;a&#39;</span>..<span style="color:#a31515;">&#39;z&#39;</span>],&nbsp;&nbsp;5,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#a31515;">&quot;ntfnc&quot;</span>)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]
&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">let</span>&nbsp;rnd&nbsp;=&nbsp;mkStdGen&nbsp;seed

&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">let</span>&nbsp;actual&nbsp;=&nbsp;rndGenSelect&nbsp;rnd&nbsp;xs&nbsp;count

&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">return</span>&nbsp;$&nbsp;expected&nbsp;~=?&nbsp;actual
</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		These tests don't drive the design, but they prevent regressions. If, at a later time, I, or someone else, inadvertently revert <code>rndGenSelect</code> to <code>genericReplicate count (head xs)</code>, these tests will fail.

	</h3>
	<p>
		The original problem statement is to write a function without an explicit <code>RandomGen</code> argument. In the spirit of <a href="http://bit.ly/xunitpatterns">xUnit Test Patterns'</a> <em>Humble Object</em> pattern, we can now click all our pieces together to a function that does what is required:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:#2b91af;">rndSelect</span>&nbsp;::&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">Integral</span>&nbsp;i&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">=&gt;</span>&nbsp;[a]&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">-&gt;</span>&nbsp;i&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">-&gt;</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">IO</span>&nbsp;[a]
rndSelect&nbsp;xs&nbsp;count&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">do</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;rnd&nbsp;&lt;-&nbsp;newStdGen
&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">return</span>&nbsp;$&nbsp;rndGenSelect&nbsp;rnd&nbsp;xs&nbsp;count
</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		The only thing of interest here is that the function is impure, because it uses <code>newStdGen</code> to produce a random <code>RandomGen</code> value. It then delegates all work to <code>rndGenSelect</code>, which is covered by tests.
	</p>
	<p>
		As you can see, this function does <em>not</em> exhibit repeatable behaviour:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>Î»&gt; rndSelect "abcdefgh" 3
"add"
Î»&gt; rndSelect "abcdefgh" 3
"daf"</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		This should, I think, address the original problem statement.

	<p>
		The first time I encountered parametric polymorphism was when C# got generics in 2005. Back then it was mostly explained as a mechanism to avoid <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/types/boxing-and-unboxing">boxing</a>, although it also seriously reduced the amount of boilerplate code you'd have to write in order to have type-safe collections. In many years, I mostly understood C# generics as a language feature aimed at efficiency and programmer productivity.
	</p>
	<p>
		It wasn't until I started to program in F#, with its stronger type inference, that it began to dawn on me that parametric polymorphism could also be a design tool. Making a function more generic tightens its contract, so to speak. The more generic a function becomes, the less wriggle room does it have. This may sound like a disadvantage to a programmer, but it's a boon to a <em>code reader</em>. When you, as a reader, encounter a parametrically polymorphic function, you already know that there are things that function can't do. Such functions come with invariants, or 'theorems', for free.
