		Several readers reacted to my small article series on <a href="/2022/11/07/applicative-assertions">applicative assertions</a>, pointing out that error-collecting assertions are already supported in more than one unit-testing framework.

	<p>
		I'm not surprised to learn that something like this exists, but let's take a quick look.
	</p>
	<h3 id="d7c0c78093084c08aa22ccaa7b86cb8a">
		NUnit Assert.Multiple <a href="#d7c0c78093084c08aa22ccaa7b86cb8a" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		Let's begin with <a href="https://nunit.org/">NUnit</a>, as this seems to be the first .NET unit-testing framework to support error-collecting assertions. As a beginning, the <a href="https://docs.nunit.org/articles/nunit/writing-tests/assertions/multiple-asserts.html">documentation example</a> works as it's supposed to:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>[Test]
<span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">void</span>&nbsp;ComplexNumberTest()
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ComplexNumber&nbsp;result&nbsp;=&nbsp;SomeCalculation();
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assert.Multiple(()&nbsp;=&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assert.AreEqual(5.2,&nbsp;result.RealPart,&nbsp;<span style="color:#a31515;">&quot;Real&nbsp;part&quot;</span>);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assert.AreEqual(3.9,&nbsp;result.ImaginaryPart,&nbsp;<span style="color:#a31515;">&quot;Imaginary&nbsp;part&quot;</span>);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;});
}</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		When you run the test, it fails (as expected) with this error message:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>Message:
&nbsp;&nbsp;Multiple failures or warnings in test:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1)   Real part
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expected: 5.2000000000000002d
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But was:  5.0999999999999996d

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2)   Imaginary part
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expected: 3.8999999999999999d
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But was:  4.0d</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		That seems to work well enough, but how does it actually work? I'm not interested in reading the NUnit source code - after all, the concept of <a href="/encapsulation-and-solid">encapsulation</a> is that one should be able to make use of the capabilities of an object without knowing all implementation details. Instead, I'll guess: Perhaps <code>Assert.Multiple</code> executes the code block in a <code>try/catch</code> block and collects the various exceptions thrown by the nested assertions.
	</p>
	<p>
		Does it catch all exception types, or only a subset?
	</p>
	<p>
		Let's try with the kind of composed assertion that I <a href="/2022/11/28/an-initial-proof-of-concept-of-applicative-assertions-in-c">previously investigated</a>:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>[Test]
<span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">void</span>&nbsp;HttpExample()
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">var</span>&nbsp;deleteResp&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">new</span>&nbsp;HttpResponseMessage(HttpStatusCode.BadRequest);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">var</span>&nbsp;getResp&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">new</span>&nbsp;HttpResponseMessage(HttpStatusCode.OK);
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assert.Multiple(()&nbsp;=&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deleteResp.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assert.That(getResp.StatusCode,&nbsp;Is.EqualTo(HttpStatusCode.NotFound));
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;});
}</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		This test fails (again, as expected). What's the error message?
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>Message:
&nbsp;&nbsp;System.Net.Http.HttpRequestException :↩
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Response status code does not indicate success: 400 (Bad Request).</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		(I've wrapped the result over multiple lines for readability. The <code>↩</code> symbol indicates where I've wrapped the text. I'll do that again later in this article.)
	</p>
	<p>
		Notice that I'm using <a href="/2020/09/28/ensuresuccessstatuscode-as-an-assertion">EnsureSuccessStatusCode as an assertion</a>. This seems to spoil the behaviour of <code>Assert.Multiple</code>. It only reports the first status code error, but not the second one.
	</p>
	<p>
		I admit that I don't fully understand what's going on here. In fact, I <em>have</em> taken a cursory glance at the relevant NUnit source code without being enlightened.
	</p>
	<p>
		One hypothesis might be that NUnit assertions throw special <code>Exception</code> sub-types that <code>Assert.Multiple</code> catch. In order to test that, I wrote a few more tests in <a href="https://fsharp.org/">F#</a> with <a href="http://www.swensensoftware.com/unquote/">Unquote</a>, assuming that, since Unquote hardly throws NUnit exceptions, the behaviour might be similar to above.
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>[&lt;Test&gt;]
<span style="color:blue;">let</span>&nbsp;Test4&nbsp;()&nbsp;=
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">let</span>&nbsp;x&nbsp;=&nbsp;1
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">let</span>&nbsp;y&nbsp;=&nbsp;2
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">let</span>&nbsp;z&nbsp;=&nbsp;3
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assert.Multiple&nbsp;(<span style="color:blue;">fun</span>&nbsp;()&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">-&gt;</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x&nbsp;=!&nbsp;y
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;y&nbsp;=!&nbsp;z)</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		The <code>=!</code> operator is an Unquote operator that I usually read as <em>must equal</em>. How does that error message look?
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>Message:
&nbsp;&nbsp;Multiple failures or warnings in test:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) 

&nbsp;&nbsp;1 = 2
&nbsp;&nbsp;false

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2)

&nbsp;&nbsp;2 = 3
&nbsp;&nbsp;false</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		Somehow, <code>Assert.Multiple</code> understands Unquote error messages, but not <code>HttpRequestException</code>. As I wrote, I don't fully understand why it behaves this way. To a degree, I'm intellectually curious enough that I'd like to know. On the other hand, from a maintainability perspective, as a user of NUnit, I shouldn't have to understand such details.
	</p>
	<h3 id="1f28e534b0f94e93bb12cbb951fa663f">
		xUnit.net Assert.Multiple <a href="#1f28e534b0f94e93bb12cbb951fa663f" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		How fares the <a href="https://xunit.net/">xUnit.net</a> port of <code>Assert.Multiple</code>?
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>[Fact]
<span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">void</span>&nbsp;HttpExample()
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">var</span>&nbsp;deleteResp&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">new</span>&nbsp;HttpResponseMessage(HttpStatusCode.BadRequest);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">var</span>&nbsp;getResp&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">new</span>&nbsp;HttpResponseMessage(HttpStatusCode.OK);
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assert.Multiple(
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;deleteResp.EnsureSuccessStatusCode(),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;Assert.Equal(HttpStatusCode.NotFound,&nbsp;getResp.StatusCode));
}</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		The API is, you'll notice, not quite identical. Where the NUnit <code>Assert.Multiple</code> method takes a single delegate as input, the xUnit.net method takes an array of actions. The difference is not only at the level of API; the behaviour is different, too:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>Message:
&nbsp;&nbsp;Multiple failures were encountered:
&nbsp;&nbsp;---- System.Net.Http.HttpRequestException :↩
&nbsp;&nbsp;Response status code does not indicate success: 400 (Bad Request).
&nbsp;&nbsp;---- Assert.Equal() Failure
&nbsp;&nbsp;Expected: NotFound
&nbsp;&nbsp;Actual:   OK</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		This error message reports both problems, as we'd like it to do.
	</p>
	<p>
		I also tried writing equivalent tests in F#, with and without Unquote, and they behave consistently with this result.
	</p>
	<p>
		If I had to use something like <code>Assert.Multiple</code>, I'd trust the xUnit.net variant more than NUnit's implementation.

		The linked documentation contains this example:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>[Fact]
<span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">void</span>&nbsp;DocExample()
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">using</span>&nbsp;(<span style="color:blue;">new</span>&nbsp;AssertionScope())

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
}</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		It fails in the expected manner:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>Message:
&nbsp;&nbsp;Expected value to be 10, but found 5 (difference of -5).
&nbsp;&nbsp;Expected string to be "Expected" with a length of 8, but "Actual" has a length of 6,↩
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;differs near "Act" (index 0).</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		How does it fare when subjected to the <code>EnsureSuccessStatusCode</code> test?
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>[Fact]
<span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">void</span>&nbsp;HttpExample()
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">var</span>&nbsp;deleteResp&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">new</span>&nbsp;HttpResponseMessage(HttpStatusCode.BadRequest);

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deleteResp.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;getResp.StatusCode.Should().Be(HttpStatusCode.NotFound);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
}</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		That test produces this error output:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>Message:
&nbsp;&nbsp;System.Net.Http.HttpRequestException :↩
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Response status code does not indicate success: 400 (Bad Request).</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		Again, <code>EnsureSuccessStatusCode</code> prevents further assertions from being evaluated. I can't say that I'm that surprised.

		Implicit or explicit <a href="#2f325809027243889d703e927a115efc" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		You might protest that using <code>EnsureSuccessStatusCode</code> and treating the resulting <code>HttpRequestException</code> as an assertion is unfair and unrealistic. Possibly. As usual, such considerations are subject to a multitude of considerations, and there's no one-size-fits-all answer.
	</p>
	<p>
		My intent with this article isn't to attack or belittle the APIs I've examined. Rather, I wanted to explore their boundaries by stress-testing them. That's one way to gain a better understanding. Being aware of an API's limitations and quirks can prevent subtle bugs.
	</p>
	<p>
		Even if you'd <em>never</em> use <code>EnsureSuccessStatusCode</code> as an assertion, perhaps you or a colleague might inadvertently do something to the same effect.
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm not surprised that both NUnit's <code>Assert.Multiple</code> and Fluent Assertions' <code>AssertionScope</code> behaves in a less consistent manner than xUnit.net's <code>Assert.Multiple</code>. The clue is in the API.
	</p>
	<p>
		The xUnit.net API looks like this:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">static</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">void</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#74531f;">Multiple</span>(<span style="color:blue;">params</span>&nbsp;Action[]&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">checks</span>)</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		Notice that each assertion is explicitly a separate action. This enables the implementation to isolate it and treat it independently of other actions.
	</p>
	<p>
		Neither the NUnit nor the Fluent Assertions API is that explicit. Instead, you can write arbitrary code inside the 'scope' of multiple assertions. For <code>AssertionScope</code>, the notion of a 'scope' is plain to see. For the NUnit API it's more implicit, but the scope is effectively the extent of the method:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">static</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">void</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#74531f;">Multiple</span>(TestDelegate&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">testDelegate</span>)</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		That <code>testDelegate</code> can have as many (nested, even) assertions as you'd like, so the <code>Multiple</code> implementation needs to somehow demarcate when it begins and when it ends.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <code>testDelegate</code> can be implemented in a different file, or even in a different library, and it has no way to communicate or coordinate with its surrounding scope. This reminds me of an Ambient Context, an idiom that <a href="/2019/01/21/some-thoughts-on-anti-patterns">Steven van Deursen convinced me was an anti-pattern</a>. The surrounding context changes the behaviour of the code block it surrounds, and it's quite implicit.
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			Explicit is better than implicit.
		</p>
		<footer><cite>Tim Peters, <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/">The Zen of Python</a></cite></footer>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		The xUnit.net API, at least, looks a bit saner. Still, this kind of API is quirky enough that it reminds me of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenspun%27s_tenth_rule">Greenspun's tenth rule</a>; that these APIs are ad-hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementations of half of <a href="/2018/10/01/applicative-functors">applicative functors</a>.

		Conclusion <a href="#95b723f05a7f4b4c88b5e716f5f82989" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		Not surprisingly, popular unit-testing and assertion libraries come with facilities to compose assertions. Also, not surprisingly, these APIs are crude and require you to learn their implementation details.
	</p>
	<p>
		Would I use them if I had to? I probably would. As <a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy/">Rich Hickey put it</a>, they're already <em>at hand</em>. That makes them easy, but not necessarily simple. APIs that compel you to learn their internal implementation details aren't simple.
	</p>
	<p>
		<a href="/2017/10/04/from-design-patterns-to-category-theory">Universal abstractions</a>, on the other hand, you only have to learn one time. Once you understand what an applicative functor is, you know what to expect from it, and which capabilities it has.
	</p>
	<p>
		In languages with good support for applicative functors, I would favour an assertion API based on that abstraction, if given a choice. At the moment, though, that's not much of an option. Even <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/HUnit/docs/Test-HUnit-Base.html#t:Assertion">HUnit assertions</a> are based on side effects.

				Just a reminder: in .NET, method's execution <b>cannot</b> be resumed after an exception is thrown, there is just simply no
				way to do this, at all.
				Which means that NUnit's Assert.Multiple absolutely cannot work the way you guess it probably does, by running the delegate and
				resuming its execution after it throws an exception until the delegate returns.
			</p>
			<p>
				How could it work then? Well, considering that documentation to almost every Assert's method has
				"Returns without throwing an exception when inside a multiple assert block" line in it,
				I would assume that Assert.Multiple sets a global flag which makes actual assertions to store the failures in some global hidden
				context instead on throwing them, then runs the delegate and after it finishes or throws, collects and clears all those failures
				from the context and resets the global flag.
			</p>
			<p>
				Cursory inspection of NUnit's source code supports this idea, except that apparently it's not just a boolean flag but a
				"depth" counter; and assertions report the failures
				<a href="https://github.com/nunit/nunit/blob/62059054137de84b711353765d474779db95f731/src/NUnitFramework/framework/Assert.cs#L371">just the way I've speculated</a>.
				I personally hate such side-channels but you have to admit, they allow for some nifty, seemingly impossible magical tricks
				(a.k.a. "spooky action at the distance").
			</p>
			<p>
				Also, why do you assume that Unquote would not throw NUnit's assertions?
				It literally has "Unquote integrates configuration-free with all exception-based unit testing frameworks including xUnit.net,
				NUnit, MbUnit, Fuchu, and MSTest" in its README, and indeed, if you look at
				<a href="https://github.com/SwensenSoftware/unquote/blob/78b071043c42372f3693a07e5562520046873ebc/src/Unquote/Assertions.fs">its source code</a>,
				you'll see that at runtime it tries to locate any testing framework it's aware of and use its assertions.
				More funny party tricks, this time with reflection!
			</p>
			<p>
				I understand that after working in more pure/functional programming environments one does start to slowly forget about
				those terrible things, but: those horrorterrors <i>still</i> exist, and people <i>keep making</i> more of them.
				Now, if you can, have a good night :)

				NUnit has <a href="https://docs.nunit.org/articles/nunit/writing-tests/assertions/classic-assertions/Assert.DoesNotThrow.html">Assert.DoesNotThrow</a>
				and Fluent Assertions has <a href="https://fluentassertions.com/exceptions/">.Should().NotThrow()</a>. I did not check Fluent Assertions, but NUnit
				does gather failures of Assert.DoesNotThrow inside Assert.Multiple into a multi-error report. One might argue that asserting that a delegate should not
				throw is another application of the "explicit is better than implicit" philosophy. Here's what Fluent Assertions has to say on that matter:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					"We know that a unit test will fail anyhow if an exception was thrown, but this syntax returns a clearer description of the exception that was thrown
					and fits better to the AAA syntax."
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				As a side note, you might also want to take a look on NUnits Assert.That syntax. It allows to construct complex conditions tested against a single
				actual value:
			</p>
			<p>
				<pre style="font-family:Consolas;font-size:13px;color:black;background:white;"><span style="color:blue;">int</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">actual</span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;3;

			</p>
			<p>
				A failure is then reported like this:
			</p>
			<p>
				<pre>Expected: greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2 and property P equal to "a"
