<div id="post">
	<p>
		It gives me great pleasure to announce that <a href="http://autofixture.codeplex.com/">AutoFixture</a> 2.0 beta 1 is now <a href="http://autofixture.codeplex.com/releases/view/50304">available for download</a>. Compared to version 1.1 AutoFixture 2.0 is implemented using a new and much more open and extensible engine that enables many interesting scenarios.
	</p>
	<p>
		Despite the new engine and the vastly increased potential, the focus on version 2.0 has been to ensure that the current, known feature set was preserved.

		What's new? <a href="#8da4f271bde546cdbf9991400adfa7d6" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		While AutoFixture 2.0 introduces new features, this release is first and foremost an upgrade to a completely new internal architecture, so the number of new releases is limited. Never the less, the following new features are available in version 2.0:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://autofixture.codeplex.com/workitem/1744">Support for enums</a></li>
		<li>Full <a href="http://autofixture.codeplex.com/workitem/4199">support of arrays</a></li>
		<li>Optional <a href="http://autofixture.codeplex.com/workitem/1913">tracing</a></li>
		<li>Improved extensibility</li>
		<li>Optional auto-mocking with <a href="http://code.google.com/p/moq/">Moq</a> (implemented as a separate, optional assembly)</li>
		<li>Optional extensions for <a href="http://xunit.codeplex.com/">xUnit.net</a> (implemented as a separate, optional assembly)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		There are still <a href="http://autofixture.codeplex.com/workitem/list/basic">open feature requests</a> for AutoFixture, so now that the new engine is in place I can again focus on implementing some of the features that were too difficult to address with the old engine.

		Breaking changes <a href="#2960d86aa1e345a9b090244e50ad675f" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		Version 2.0 introduces some breaking changes, although the fundamental API remains recognizable.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			A lot of the original methods on Fixture are now extension methods on IFixture (a new interface). The methods include CreateAnonymous&lt;T&gt;, CreateMany&lt;T&gt; and many others, so you will need to include a using directive for Ploeh.AutoFixture to compile the unit test code.
		</li>
		<li>
			CreateMany&lt;T&gt; still returns IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;, but the return value is much more consistently deferred. This means that in almost all cases you should instantly stabilize the sequence by converting it to a List&lt;T&gt;, an array or similar.
		</li>
		<li>
			Several methods are now deprecated in favor of new methods with better names.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		A few methods were also removed, but only those that were already deprecated in version 1.1.
	</p>

		Roadmap <a href="#991099f6397648ceab0140f2b368a74b" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		The general availability of beta 1 of AutoFixture 2.0 marks the beginning of a trial period. If no new issues are reported within the next few weeks, a final version 2.0 will be released. If too many issues are reported, a new beta version may be necessary.
	</p>
	<p>
		Please <a href="http://autofixture.codeplex.com/workitem/list/basic">report any issues</a> you find.
	</p>
	<p>
		After the release of the final version 2.0 my plan is currently to focus on the <a href="http://autofixture.codeplex.com/workitem/1650">Idioms project</a>, although there are many other new features that might warrant my attention.
	</p>
	<p>
		Blog posts about the new features will also follow soon.

	<div class="comment-content">One thing i somehow can't understand - when exactly there's a need for such a framework as AutoFixture?<br>
<br>
P.s. Just don't read it wrong - I didn't say it's useless. Problem is with me. :)</div>

	<div class="comment-content">That's a reasonable question. The short answer is provided by AutoFixture's tag line: <em>Write maintainable unit tests, faster.</em><br>
