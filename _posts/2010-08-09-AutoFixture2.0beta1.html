<div id="post">
	<p>It gives me great pleasure to announce that <a href="http://autofixture.codeplex.com/">AutoFixture</a> 2.0 beta 1 is now <a href="http://autofixture.codeplex.com/releases/view/50304">available for download</a>. Compared to version 1.1 AutoFixture 2.0 is implemented using a new and much more open and extensible engine that enables many interesting scenarios.</p> <p>Despite the new engine and the vastly increased potential, the focus on version 2.0 has been to ensure that the current, known feature set was preserved.</p> <p><strong>What's new?</strong></p> <p>While AutoFixture 2.0 introduces new features, this release is first and foremost an upgrade to a completely new internal architecture, so the number of new releases is limited. Never the less, the following new features are available in version 2.0:</p> <ul> <li><a href="http://autofixture.codeplex.com/workitem/1744">Support for enums</a>  <li>Full <a href="http://autofixture.codeplex.com/workitem/4199">support of arrays</a>  <li>Optional <a href="http://autofixture.codeplex.com/workitem/1913">tracing</a>  <li>Improved extensibility  <li>Optional auto-mocking with <a href="http://code.google.com/p/moq/">Moq</a> (implemented as a separate, optional assembly)  <li>Optional extensions for <a href="http://xunit.codeplex.com/">xUnit.net</a> (implemented as a separate, optional assembly)</li></ul> <p>There are still <a href="http://autofixture.codeplex.com/workitem/list/basic">open feature requests</a> for AutoFixture, so now that the new engine is in place I can again focus on implementing some of the features that were too difficult to address with the old engine.</p> <p><strong>Breaking changes</strong></p> <p>Version 2.0 introduces some breaking changes, although the fundamental API remains recognizable.</p> <ul> <li>A lot of the original methods on Fixture are now extension methods on IFixture (a new interface). The methods include CreateAnonymous&lt;T&gt;, CreateMany&lt;T&gt; and many others, so you will need to include a using directive for Ploeh.AutoFixture to compile the unit test code.  <li>CreateMany&lt;T&gt; still returns IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;, but the return value is much more consistently deferred. This means that in almost all cases you should instantly stabilize the sequence by converting it to a List&lt;T&gt;, an array or similar.  <li>Several methods are now deprecated in favor of new methods with better names.</li></ul> <p>A few methods were also removed, but only those that were already deprecated in version 1.1.</p> <p><strong>Roadmap</strong></p> <p>The general availability of beta 1 of AutoFixture 2.0 marks the beginning of a trial period. If no new issues are reported within the next few weeks, a final version 2.0 will be released. If too many issues are reported, a new beta version may be necessary.</p> <p>Please <a href="http://autofixture.codeplex.com/workitem/list/basic">report any issues</a> you find.</p> <p>After the release of the final version 2.0 my plan is currently to focus on the <a href="http://autofixture.codeplex.com/workitem/1650">Idioms project</a>, although there are many other new features that might warrant my attention.</p> <p>Blog posts about the new features will also follow soon.</p>

	<div class="comment-content">One thing i somehow can't understand - when exactly there's a need for such a framework as AutoFixture?<br>
<br>
P.s. Just don't read it wrong - I didn't say it's useless. Problem is with me. :)</div>

	<div class="comment-content">That's a reasonable question. The short answer is provided by AutoFixture's tag line: <em>Write maintainable unit tests, faster.</em><br>
