		<em>When you use Semantic Versioning with Continuous Deployment, version numbers must be checked into source control systems by programmers.</em>
	</p>
	<p>
		If you aren't already using <a href="http://semver.org">Semantic Versioning</a>, you should. It makes it <em>much</em> easier to figure out how to version your releases. Even if you're 'just' building software for your internal organization, or a single customer, <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2012/12/18/ZookeepersmustbecomeRangers">you should still care about versioning of the software you release</a>. Instead of an ad-hoc versioning scheme, Semantic Versioning offers a set of easy-to-understand rules about when to increment which version number.
	</p>
	<p>
		In short, you
		<ul>
			<li>increment the patch version (e.g. from 2.3.4 to 2.3.5) when you only release bug fixes and the like</li>
			<li>increment the minor version (e.g. from 1.3.2 to 1.4.0) when you add new features</li>
			<li>increment the major version (e.g. from 3.2.9 to 4.0.0) when you introduce breaking changes</li>
		</ul>
		This makes it much easier for you when you need to make a decision on a new version number, and it also makes it much easier for consumers of your software to understand when an update is 'safe', and when they should set aside some time to test compatibility.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Continuous Deployment</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		While Semantic Versioning is great, it requires a bit of consideration when combined with <a href="http://puppetlabs.com/blog/continuous-delivery-vs-continuous-deployment-whats-diff">Continuous Deployment</a>. Every time you deploy a new version, you should increment the version number.
	</p>
	<p>
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery">Continuous Delivery</a> and Continuous Deployment rely on automation. A code check-in triggers an automated build, which is is subsequently processed by a Deployment Pipeline, and potentially released to end-users. Each released (or releasable) build should have a unique version.
	</p>
	<p>
		Traditionally, Build Servers have had the responsibility of incrementing version numbers - typically by incrementing a <em>build</em> number, like this:
		<ol>
			<li>3.7.11.942</li>
			<li>3.7.12.958</li>
			<li>3.7.13.959</li>
			<li>3.7.14.979</li>
			<li>3.7.15.987</li>
		</ol>
		where the fourth number is a <em>revision</em> number, that may correspond to a revision ID in a source control system (whether or not that makes sense, depends on which version control system you use).
	</p>
	<p>
		Unfortunately, this versioning scheme is <em>wrong</em> if you combine Semantic Versioning with Continuous Deployment. Even if you throw away the fourth <em>build</em> number, you're left with a sequence like this:
		<ol>
			<li>3.7.11 (bug fix)</li>
			<li>3.7.12 (partial new feature, hidden behind a <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FeatureToggle.html">Feature Toggle</a>.)</li>
			<li>3.7.13 (performance improvement)</li>
			<li>3.7.14 (completed feature initiated in 3.7.12)</li>
			<li>3.7.15 (breaking changes in public API)</li>
		</ol>
		That's not Semantic Versioning.
	</p>
	<p>
		Semantic Versioning might look like this:
		<ol>
			<li>3.7.11 (bug fix)</li>
			<li>3.7.12 (partial new feature, hidden behind a <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FeatureToggle.html">Feature Toggle</a>.)</li>
			<li>3.7.13 (performance improvement)</li>
			<li>3.8.0 (completed feature initiated in 3.7.12)</li>
			<li>4.0.0 (breaking changes in public API)</li>
		</ol>
		This doesn't work well with automatically incrementing the version number.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Versioning is a programmer decision</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		With Continuous Deployment, every time you integrate code (check in, merge, rebase, whatever), you produce a version of the software that will be deployed. This means that every time you integrate, <em>something</em> or <em>somebody</em> should assign a new version to the software.
	</p>
	<p>
		The rules of Semantic Versioning require explicit decisions to be made. Only the development team understands what a particular commit contains. Is it a a fix? Is it a new feature? Is it a breaking change? A Build Server doesn't know how to answer these questions, but <em>you</em> do.
	</p>
	<p>
		A few years ago, I changed the delivery scheme for my open source project <a href="https://github.com/AutoFixture/AutoFixture">AutoFixture</a> to use <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2011/09/06/AutoFixturegoesContinuousDeliverywithSemanticVersioning">Semantic Versioning with Continuous Deployment</a>. When I did that, I realised that I could no longer rely on a Build Server for controlling the version. Instead, I would have to explicitly control the versioning as part of the commit process.
	</p>
	<p>
		Because AutoFixture is a .NET project, I decided to use the version assignment mechanism already present in the framework: The <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.reflection.assemblyversionattribute.aspx">[AssemblyVersion]</a> and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.reflection.assemblyfileversionattribute.aspx">[AssemblyFileVersion]</a> attributes that you typically put in AssemblyInfo files.
	</p>
	<p>
		The version control system used for AutoFixture is <a href="http://git-scm.com">Git</a>, so it works like this in practice:
		<ol>
			<li>A programmer adds one or more commits to a branch.</li>
			<li>The programmer sends a pull request.</li>
			<li>I pull down the commits from the pull request.</li>
			<li>I increment <em>all</em> the version attributes in <em>all</em> the AssemblyInfo files, and commit that change.</li>
			<li>I push the commits to <em>master</em>.</li>
			<li>The Build Server picks up the new commits, and the Deployment Pipeline kicks in.</li>
		</ol>
		This works well. You can see an example of this process if you examine <a href="https://github.com/AutoFixture/AutoFixture/commits/master">the commit log for AutoFixture</a>. The only problem is that AutoFixture has 28 AssemblyInfo files (each with two version attributes) that I must update and keep in sync. That's a lot of work, so obviously a target for automation, but that's the subject for another blog post.
	</p>
	<p>
		After more than two years of experience with this way of controlling software versions, I'm consistently using this approach for all <a href="https://github.com/ploeh">my open source software</a>, as well as the internal software we create in <a href="http://grean.com">Grean</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Summary</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		If you want to use Continuous Deployment (or Delivery) with Semantic Versioning, the assignment of a new version number is a programmer decision. Only a human understands when a commit constitutes a bug fix, a new feature, or a breaking change. The new version number must be committed to the version control system, so that whomever or whatever compiles and/or releases the software will always use the same version number for the same version of the source code.
	</p>
	<p>
		The version number is kept in the source control system, together with the source code. It's not the realm of a Build Server.
