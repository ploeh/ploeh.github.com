		<em>When you use Semantic Versioning with Continuous Deployment, version numbers must be checked into source control systems by programmers.</em>
	</p>
	<p>
		If you aren't already using <a href="http://semver.org">Semantic Versioning</a>, you should. It makes it <em>much</em> easier to figure out how to version your releases. Even if you're 'just' building software for your internal organization, or a single customer, <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2012/12/18/ZookeepersmustbecomeRangers">you should still care about versioning of the software you release</a>. Instead of an ad-hoc versioning scheme, Semantic Versioning offers a set of easy-to-understand rules about when to increment which version number.
	</p>
	<p>
		In short, you
		<ul>
			<li>increment the patch version (e.g. from 2.3.4 to 2.3.5) when you only release bug fixes and the like</li>
			<li>increment the minor version (e.g. from 1.3.2 to 1.4.0) when you add new features</li>
			<li>increment the major version (e.g. from 3.2.9 to 4.0.0) when you introduce breaking changes</li>
		</ul>
		This makes it much easier for you when you need to make a decision on a new version number, and it also makes it much easier for consumers of your software to understand when an update is 'safe', and when they should set aside some time to test compatibility.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Continuous Deployment</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		While Semantic Versioning is great, it requires a bit of consideration when combined with <a href="http://puppetlabs.com/blog/continuous-delivery-vs-continuous-deployment-whats-diff">Continuous Deployment</a>. Every time you deploy a new version, you should increment the version number.
	</p>
	<p>
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery">Continuous Delivery</a> and Continuous Deployment rely on automation. A code check-in triggers an automated build, which is is subsequently processed by a Deployment Pipeline, and potentially released to end-users. Each released (or releasable) build should have a unique version.
	</p>
	<p>
		Traditionally, Build Servers have had the responsibility of incrementing version numbers - typically by incrementing a <em>build</em> number, like this:
		<ol>
			<li>3.7.11.942</li>
			<li>3.7.12.958</li>
			<li>3.7.13.959</li>
			<li>3.7.14.979</li>
			<li>3.7.15.987</li>
		</ol>
		where the fourth number is a <em>revision</em> number, that may correspond to a revision ID in a source control system (whether or not that makes sense, depends on which version control system you use).
	</p>
	<p>
		Unfortunately, this versioning scheme is <em>wrong</em> if you combine Semantic Versioning with Continuous Deployment. Even if you throw away the fourth <em>build</em> number, you're left with a sequence like this:
		<ol>
			<li>3.7.11 (bug fix)</li>
			<li>3.7.12 (partial new feature, hidden behind a <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FeatureToggle.html">Feature Toggle</a>.)</li>
			<li>3.7.13 (performance improvement)</li>
			<li>3.7.14 (completed feature initiated in 3.7.12)</li>
			<li>3.7.15 (breaking changes in public API)</li>
		</ol>
		That's not Semantic Versioning.
	</p>
	<p>
		Semantic Versioning might look like this:
		<ol>
			<li>3.7.11 (bug fix)</li>
			<li>3.7.12 (partial new feature, hidden behind a <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FeatureToggle.html">Feature Toggle</a>.)</li>
			<li>3.7.13 (performance improvement)</li>
			<li>3.8.0 (completed feature initiated in 3.7.12)</li>
			<li>4.0.0 (breaking changes in public API)</li>
		</ol>
		This doesn't work well with automatically incrementing the version number.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Versioning is a programmer decision</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		With Continuous Deployment, every time you integrate code (check in, merge, rebase, whatever), you produce a version of the software that will be deployed. This means that every time you integrate, <em>something</em> or <em>somebody</em> should assign a new version to the software.
	</p>
	<p>
		The rules of Semantic Versioning require explicit decisions to be made. Only the development team understands what a particular commit contains. Is it a a fix? Is it a new feature? Is it a breaking change? A Build Server doesn't know how to answer these questions, but <em>you</em> do.
	</p>
	<p>
		A few years ago, I changed the delivery scheme for my open source project <a href="https://github.com/AutoFixture/AutoFixture">AutoFixture</a> to use <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2011/09/06/AutoFixturegoesContinuousDeliverywithSemanticVersioning">Semantic Versioning with Continuous Deployment</a>. When I did that, I realised that I could no longer rely on a Build Server for controlling the version. Instead, I would have to explicitly control the versioning as part of the commit process.
	</p>
	<p>
		Because AutoFixture is a .NET project, I decided to use the version assignment mechanism already present in the framework: The <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.reflection.assemblyversionattribute.aspx">[AssemblyVersion]</a> and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.reflection.assemblyfileversionattribute.aspx">[AssemblyFileVersion]</a> attributes that you typically put in AssemblyInfo files.
	</p>
	<p>
		The version control system used for AutoFixture is <a href="http://git-scm.com">Git</a>, so it works like this in practice:
		<ol>
			<li>A programmer adds one or more commits to a branch.</li>
			<li>The programmer sends a pull request.</li>
			<li>I pull down the commits from the pull request.</li>
			<li>I increment <em>all</em> the version attributes in <em>all</em> the AssemblyInfo files, and commit that change.</li>
			<li>I push the commits to <em>master</em>.</li>
			<li>The Build Server picks up the new commits, and the Deployment Pipeline kicks in.</li>
		</ol>
		This works well. You can see an example of this process if you examine <a href="https://github.com/AutoFixture/AutoFixture/commits/master">the commit log for AutoFixture</a>. The only problem is that AutoFixture has 28 AssemblyInfo files (each with two version attributes) that I must update and keep in sync. That's a lot of work, so obviously a target for automation, but that's the subject for another blog post.
	</p>
	<p>
		After more than two years of experience with this way of controlling software versions, I'm consistently using this approach for all <a href="https://github.com/ploeh">my open source software</a>, as well as the internal software we create in <a href="http://grean.com">Grean</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Summary</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		If you want to use Continuous Deployment (or Delivery) with Semantic Versioning, the assignment of a new version number is a programmer decision. Only a human understands when a commit constitutes a bug fix, a new feature, or a breaking change. The new version number must be committed to the version control system, so that whomever or whatever compiles and/or releases the software will always use the same version number for the same version of the source code.
	</p>
	<p>
		The version number is kept in the source control system, together with the source code. It's not the realm of a Build Server.

				Augi, it's true that you can create other approaches in order to attempt to address the issue, but the bottom line remains that a <em>human being</em> must make the decision about how to increment the version number. As you suggest, you can put information guiding that decision outside the source code itself, but then you'd be introducing another movable part that can break. If you do something like you suggest, you'll still need to add some machine-readable metadata to the linked issue ID. To add spite to injury, this also makes it more difficult to reproduce what the Build Server does on your local machine - particularly if you're attempting to build while offline.
			</p>
			<p>
				While it sounds like it would be possible, what do you gain by doing something like that?

				Mark, I also have a Visual Studio solution or two with multiple AssemblyInfo.cs files (although not as many
				as you) and wish to use a common version number for each contained project.  I came up with the following
				approach, which doesn't require any automation.  It only uses the Visual Studio/MSBuild
				&lt;Link /&gt; functionality.  The key is simply to use the
				<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsphone/develop/jj714082(v=vs.105).aspx">Add As Link</a>
				functionality for common attributes.
			</p>
			<p>
				Simply put, I split out the common information (Version info and company/copyright/trademark info) from
				projects' AssemblyInfo.cs files into another file called SolutionAssemblyInfo.cs.  I place that file at the
				root of the solution (outside of any project folders).  Then, for each project, remove the version information
				from the AssemblyInfo.cs file and use the 'Add As Link' function in the 'Add Existing Item'
				function in Visual Studio to link to the SolutionAssemblyInfo.cs file.  With that, you have only one place
				to update the version information: the SolutionAssemblyInfo.cs file.  Any change to that version
				information will be included in each project.
			</p>
			<p>
				That might be enough information to get you going, but if not, I'll expand and outline the specific process.
				The basic idea is to look at the AssemblyInfo.cs file as having two sets of metadata:
				<ul>
					<li>Metadata specific to the project itself:
						<ul>
							<li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.reflection.assemblytitleattribute.aspx">[AssemblyTitle]</a></li>
							<li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.reflection.AssemblyDescriptionattribute.aspx">[AssemblyDescription]</a></li>
							<li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.reflection.AssemblyConfigurationattribute.aspx">[AssemblyConfiguration]</a></li>
							<li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.reflection.AssemblyProductattribute.aspx">[AssemblyProduct]</a></li>
							<li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.reflection.AssemblyCultureattribute.aspx">[AssemblyCulture]</a></li>
							<li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComVisibleAttribute.aspx">[ComVisible]</a></li>
							<li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/System.Runtime.InteropServices.GuidAttribute.aspx">[Guid]</a></li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Metadata that really should be shared amongst all projects in the solution.  Specifically:
						<ul>
							<li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.reflection.assemblyversionattribute.aspx">[AssemblyVersion]</a></li>
							<li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.reflection.assemblyfileversionattribute.aspx">[AssemblyFileVersion]</a></li>
							<li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.reflection.assemblyinformationalversionattribute.aspx">[AssemblyInformationalVersion]</a> (Although, depending on your needs, you may choose to leave this attribute in the project-specifics AssemblyInfo.cs)</li>
							<li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.reflection.AssemblyCompanyattribute.aspx">[AssemblyCompany]</a></li>
							<li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.reflection.AssemblyCopyrightattribute.aspx">[AssemblyCopyright]</a></li>
							<li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.reflection.AssemblyTrademarkattribute.aspx">[AssemblyTrademark]</a></li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				You can separate the shared metadata into a common AssemblyInfo.cs
				file.  Then, by linking to that common file in each project (as opposed to including), you won't need
				to update 28 files; you'll only need to update the common one.
			</p>
			<p>
				Assume I have the following AssemblyInfo.cs file for one of my projects:
				<blockquote><pre>
// AssemblyInfo.cs
using System.Reflection;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;

[assembly: AssemblyTitle("SampleProject")]
[assembly: AssemblyDescription("")]
[assembly: AssemblyConfiguration("")]
[assembly: AssemblyCompany("Company Name")]
[assembly: AssemblyProduct("SampleProject")]
[assembly: AssemblyCopyright("Copyright (c) Company Name 2013")]
[assembly: AssemblyTrademark("")]
[assembly: AssemblyCulture("")]

[assembly: ComVisible(false)]

[assembly: Guid("7ae5f3ab-e519-4c44-bb65-489305fc36b0")]

[assembly: AssemblyVersion("1.0.0.0")]
[assembly: AssemblyFileVersion("1.0.0.0")]
				</pre></blockquote>

				I split this out into two files:
				<blockquote><pre>
// AssemblyInfo.cs
using System.Reflection;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;

[assembly: AssemblyTitle("SampleProject")]
[assembly: AssemblyDescription("")]
[assembly: AssemblyConfiguration("")]
[assembly: AssemblyProduct("SampleProject")]
[assembly: AssemblyCulture("")]

[assembly: ComVisible(false)]

[assembly: Guid("7ae5f3ab-e519-4c44-bb65-489305fc36b0")]
				</pre></blockquote>
	and
				<blockquote><pre>
// SolutionAssemblyInfo.cs
using System.Reflection;

[assembly: AssemblyCompany("Company Name")]
[assembly: AssemblyCopyright("Copyright (c) Company Name 2013")]
[assembly: AssemblyTrademark("")]

[assembly: AssemblyVersion("1.0.0.0")]
[assembly: AssemblyFileVersion("1.0.0.0")]
// Depending on your needs, AssemblyInformationalVersion as well?
				</pre></blockquote>
			</p>
			<p>
				The SolutionAssemblyInfo.cs goes in the root of your solution and should
				initially not be included in any projects.  Then, for each project:
				<ul>
					<li>Remove all attributes that went into SolutionAssemblyInfo.cs</li>
					<li>Right-click the project and &quot;Add..., Existing Item...&quot;</li>
					<li>Navigate to the SolutionAssemblyInfo.cs file</li>
					<li>Instead of clicking the &quot;Add&quot; button, click the little drop-down on it and select
					&quot;Add As Link&quot;</li>
					<li>If you want the new linked SolutionAssemblyInfo.cs file to show up under the Properties folder
					(like the AssesmblyInfo.cs file), just drag it from the project root into the Properties folder.
					Unfortunately, you can't simply add the link to the Properties folder directly (at least not in VS 2012).</li>
				</ul>

				(Note: it looks like there may be an easier method in VS 2012+ only to get the &quot;Add As Link&quot; function, mentioned
				<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/12858818/208990">on StackOverflow</a>, by simply dragging and dropping while
				holding the Alt key.)
			</p>
			<p>
				That's it.  Now, you will be able to access this SolutionAssemblyInfo.cs file from any of your projects
				and any changes you make to that file will persist into the linked file, being shared with all projects.
			</p>
			<p>
				The downside to this, as opposed to an automation solution, is that you need to repeat this process
				(starting with &quot;Remove all attributes...&quot;) for all new projects you add.  However, in my
				opinion, that's a small, one-time-per-project price to pay.  With the above, you let the established
				tool work for you with built-in features.
