		In my <a href="/2009/01/28/Zero-FrictionTDD">Zero-Friction TDD</a> series, I focus on establishing a set of good habits that can potentially make you more productive while writing tests TDD style. While being able to quickly write good tests is important, this is not the only quality on which you should focus.
	</p>
	<p>
		Maintainability, not only of your production code, but also of your test code, is important, and the DRY principle is just as applicable here.
	</p>
	<p>
		Consider a test like this:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre style="margin: 0px">[<span style="color: #2b91af">TestMethod</span>]
<span style="color: blue">public</span> <span style="color: blue">void</span> SomeTestUsingConstructorToCreateSut()
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: green">// Fixture setup</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: #2b91af">MyClass</span> sut = <span style="color: blue">new</span> <span style="color: #2b91af">MyClass</span>();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: green">// Exercise system</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: green">// ...</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: green">// Verify outcome</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: green">// ...</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: green">// Teardown</span>
}</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		Such a test represents an anti-pattern you can easily fall victim to. The main item of interest here is that I create the <a href="http://xunitpatterns.com/SUT.html">SUT</a> using its constructor. You could say that I have hard-coded this particular constructor usage into my test.
	</p>
	<p>
		This is not a problem if there's only one test of MyClass, but once you have many, this starts to become a drag on your ability to refactor your code.
	</p>
	<p>
		Imagine that you want to change the constructor of MyClass from the default constructor to one that takes a dependency, like this:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre style="margin: 0px"><span style="color: blue">public</span> MyClass(<span style="color: #2b91af">IMyInterface</span> dependency)</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		If you have many (in this case, not <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ploeh/archive/2008/12/08/3-is-many.aspx">three</a>, but dozens) tests using the default constructor, this simple change will force you to visit all these tests and modify them to be able to compile again.
	</p>
	<p>
		If, instead, we use a factory to create the SUT in each test, there's a single place where we can go and update the creation logic.
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre style="margin: 0px">[<span style="color: #2b91af">TestMethod</span>]
<span style="color: blue">public</span> <span style="color: blue">void</span> SomeTestUsingFactoryToCreateSut()
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: green">// Fixture setup</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: #2b91af">MyClass</span> sut = <span style="color: #2b91af">MyClassFactory</span>.Create();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: green">// Exercise system</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: green">// ...</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: green">// Verify outcome</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: green">// ...</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: green">// Teardown</span>
}</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		The MyClassFactory class is a test-specific helper class (more formally, it's part of our <a href="http://xunitpatterns.com/Test%20Utility%20Method.html#SUT%20API%20Encapsulation">SUT API Encapsulation</a>) that is part of the unit test project. Using this factory, we only need to modify the Create method to implement the constructor change.
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre style="margin: 0px"><span style="color: blue">internal</span> <span style="color: blue">static</span> <span style="color: #2b91af">MyClass</span> Create()
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: #2b91af">IMyInterface</span> fake = <span style="color: blue">new</span> <span style="color: #2b91af">FakeMyInterface</span>();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue">return</span> <span style="color: blue">new</span> <span style="color: #2b91af">MyClass</span>(fake);
}</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		Instead of having to modify many individual tests to support the signature change of the constructor, there's now one central place where we can go and do that. This pattern supports refactoring much better, so consider making this a habit of yours.
	</p>
	<p>
		One exception to this rule concerns tests that explicitly deal with the constructor, such as this one:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre style="margin: 0px">[<span style="color: #2b91af">ExpectedException</span>(<span style="color: blue">typeof</span>(<span style="color: #2b91af">ArgumentNullException</span>))]
[<span style="color: #2b91af">TestMethod</span>]
<span style="color: blue">public</span> <span style="color: blue">void</span> CreateWithNullMyInterfaceWillThrow()
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: green">// Fixture setup</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: #2b91af">IMyInterface</span> nullMyInterface = <span style="color: blue">null</span>;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: green">// Exercise system</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue">new</span> <span style="color: #2b91af">MyClass</span>(nullMyInterface);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: green">// Verify outcome (expected exception)</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: green">// Teardown</span>
}</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		In a case like this, where you explicitly want to deal with the constructor in an anomalous way, I consider it reasonable to deviate from the rule of using a factory to create the SUT. Although this may result in a need to fix the SUT creation logic in more than one place, instead of only in the factory itself, it's likely to be constrained to a few places instead of dozens or more, since normally, you will only have a handful of these explicit constructor tests.
	</p>
	<p>
		Compared to my Zero-Friction TDD tips and tricks, this particular advice has the potential to marginally slow you down. However, this investments pays off when you want to refactor your SUT's constructor, and remember that you can always just write the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ploeh/archive/2009/01/05/use-the-generate-method-stub-smart-tag-to-stay-in-the-zone.aspx">call to the factory and move on without implementing it right away</a>.

	<div class="comment-content">Another approach is to let the test fixture hold the SUT in a field and then instantiate it in the test initialize method. This way all tests will have access to a default instance of the SUT, without cluttering the test itself with details of how it was created. Since dependencies will also be created in test init, your tests will also be able to access the stubs or mocks for verification.<br>

<br>
Thank you for your comment.<br>
<br>
While you are right that technically, this is another option, I don't like to use Implicit Setup, since it doesn't clearly communicate intent. If you have dozens of test cases in a single Test Class, the Setup may not be very apparant; in essence, it's clouding the state of the Fixture, since it's not readily visible (it may be in a completely different secion of the file).<br>
<br>
Another reason I don't like this approach is that it tightly couples the Test Class to the Fixture, and it makes it harder to vary the Fixture within the same Test Class.<br>
<br>
Explicitly setting up the Fixture provides a greater degree of flexibility, since you can always overload the SUT Factory to create the SUT in different ways.</div>

	<div class="comment-content">I like this pattern. What's your opinion on doing the same thing within the method decorated with [TestIntialize] attr (MS Test), or even in constructor (i.e xUnit)? It achieves the same result (or may be even better) IMO.</div>

	<div class="comment-content">Raj, the problem with this approach is that in order to be maintainable you would need to adopt the <a href="http://xunitpatterns.com/Testcase%20Class%20per%20Fixture.html">Testcase Class per Fixture</a> pattern, because if you don't the test class will eventually suffer from low cohesion. However, most people (myself included) tend to find this pattern counter-intuitive and rather prefer <a href="http://xunitpatterns.com/Testcase%20Class%20per%20Class.html">Testcase Class per Class</a>.</div>
