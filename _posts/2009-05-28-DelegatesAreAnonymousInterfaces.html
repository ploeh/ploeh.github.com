		This is really nothing new, but I don't think I've explicitly stated this before: It makes a lot of sense to view delegates as anonymous one-method interfaces.
	</p>
	<p>
		Many people liken delegates to function pointers. While that's probably correct (I wouldn't really know), it's not a very object-oriented view to take  -  at least not when we are dealing with managed code. To me, it makes more sense to view delegates as anonymous one-method interfaces.
	</p>
	<p>
		Lets consider a simple example. As always, we have the ubiquitous MyClass with its DoStuff method. In this example, DoStuff takes as input an abstraction that takes a string as input and returns an integer  -  let's imagine that this is some kind of Strategy (notice the capital <em>S</em>  -  I'm talking about the design pattern, here).
	</p>
	<p>
		In traditional object-oriented design, we could solve this by introducing the IMyInterface type:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre style="margin: 0px"><span style="color: blue">public</span> <span style="color: blue">interface</span> <span style="color: #2b91af">IMyInterface</span>
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue">int</span> DoIt(<span style="color: blue">string</span> message);
}</pre>
</p>
<p>The implementation of DoStuff is simply:</p>
<p>
	<pre style="margin: 0px"><span style="color: blue">public</span> <span style="color: blue">string</span> DoStuff(<span style="color: #2b91af">IMyInterface</span> strategy)
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue">return</span> strategy.DoIt(<span style="color: #a31515">"Ploeh"</span>).ToString();
}</pre>
</p>
<p>Hardly rocket science…</p>
<p>However, defining a completely new interface just to do this is not really necessary, since we could just as well have implemented DoStuff with a Func&lt;string, int&gt;:</p>
<p>
	<pre style="margin: 0px"><span style="color: blue">public</span> <span style="color: blue">string</span> DoStuff(<span style="color: #2b91af">Func</span>&lt;<span style="color: blue">string</span>, <span style="color: blue">int</span>&gt; strategy)
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue">return</span> strategy(<span style="color: #a31515">"Ploeh"</span>).ToString();
}</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		This not only frees us from defining a new interface, but also from implementing that interface to use the DoStuff method. Instead, we can simply pass a lambda expression:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre style="margin: 0px"><span style="color: blue">string</span> result = sut.DoStuff(s =&gt; s.Count());</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		What's most amazing is that <a href="http://ayende.com/projects/rhino-mocks.aspx">RhinoMocks</a> understands and treats delegates just like other abstract types, so that we can write the following to treat it as a mock:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre style="margin: 0px"><span style="color: green">// Fixture setup</span>
<span style="color: #2b91af">Func</span>&lt;<span style="color: blue">string</span>, <span style="color: blue">int</span>&gt; mock =
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: #2b91af">MockRepository</span>.GenerateMock&lt;<span style="color: #2b91af">Func</span>&lt;<span style="color: blue">string</span>, <span style="color: blue">int</span>&gt;&gt;();
mock.Expect(f =&gt; f(<span style="color: #a31515">"Ploeh"</span>)).Return(42);
<span style="color: blue">var</span> sut = <span style="color: blue">new</span> <span style="color: #2b91af">MyClass</span>();
<span style="color: green">// Exercise system</span>
<span style="color: blue">string</span> result = sut.DoStuff(mock);
<span style="color: green">// Verify outcome</span>
mock.VerifyAllExpectations();
<span style="color: green">// Teardown</span></pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		Whenever possible, I prefer to model my APIs with delegates instead of one-method interfaces, since it gives me greater flexibility and less infrastructure code.
	</p>
	<p>
		Obviously, this technique only works as long as you only need to abstract a single method. As soon as your abstraction needs a second method, you will need to introduce a proper interface or, preferably, an abstract base class.

<br>
We shouldn't believe that delegates are unlike a function pointer just because the latter is not object-oriented. The shoe ... fits. Furthermore, I would argue that an anonymous one-method interfaces is not a first-class object-oriented concept; we can describe it with words, but I doubt that you will find any of the non-.NET literature talking about such a thing. Well ... I will grant that mention might be made under a description of the command pattern.<br>
<br>
&quot;Obviously, this technique only works as long as you only need to abstract a single method.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yes. Then we are in trouble and we didn't even swim that far from shore.<br>
<br>
What was the problem? We focussed too much on a method and we ignored the interface. An interface defines the contract of which the method is only a part. The contract is identified by the name of the interface. There is no contract defined by method signatures. &quot;Takes an int and a double and returns a string&quot; doesn't mean anything.<br>
<br>
In summary, focussing on the method is every bit as dirty as ... function pointers.<br>
<br>
