<div id="post">
	<p>It gives me great pleasure to announce that I have just release version .8.5 of <a href="http://autofixture.codeplex.com/">AutoFixture</a>. It is a minor release (hence the numbering) that mainly contains a lot of convenience overloads to already existing methods. There is also a single bug fix.</p> <p>There are two breaking changes (documented on the <a href="http://autofixture.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=31587">release page</a>), but they are minor and I do not expect them to cause problems. Only one of these even remotely affects any part of the API I have already discussed here, and that relates to what kind of exception is being thrown <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2009/04/23/DealingWithTypesWithoutPublicConstructors.aspx">when AutoFixture is unable to create an instance of the requested type</a>.</p> <p>Please go ahead and download it and use it heavily :) As always, comments and questions are welcome.</p>
