	<p>
		It gives me great pleasure to announce that I have just release version .8.5 of <a href="http://autofixture.codeplex.com/">AutoFixture</a>. It is a minor release (hence the numbering) that mainly contains a lot of convenience overloads to already existing methods. There is also a single bug fix.
	</p>
	<p>
		There are two breaking changes (documented on the <a href="http://autofixture.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=31587">release page</a>), but they are minor and I do not expect them to cause problems. Only one of these even remotely affects any part of the API I have already discussed here, and that relates to what kind of exception is being thrown <a href="/2009/04/23/DealingWithTypesWithoutPublicConstructors">when AutoFixture is unable to create an instance of the requested type</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Please go ahead and download it and use it heavily :) As always, comments and questions are welcome.
