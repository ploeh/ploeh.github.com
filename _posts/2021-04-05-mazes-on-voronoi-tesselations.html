		<a href="https://observablehq.com">Observable</a> is a really neat platform which has managed to do what I thought was nigh-impossible: make me return to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>. The site's <a href="https://observablehq.com/about">been around for some years</a>, and I hope it'll be around for even more years.

		<em>ploeh blog</em>, on the other hand, has been around <a href="/2009/01/28/LivingInInterestingTimes">since 2009</a>, and I intend to keep it around for much longer. Who knows if <em>Observable</em> will outlive the blog. Enjoy the article while it's there.
