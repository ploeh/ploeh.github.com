		The <a href="http://www.natpryce.com/articles/000714.html">Test Data Builder</a> design pattern is a valuable technique for managing data for unit testing. It enables you to express test cases in such a way that the important parts of the test case stands out in your code, while the unimportant parts disappear. It perfectly fits <a href="http://amzn.to/19W4JHk">Robert C. Martin's definition</a> of an <em>abstraction:</em>
		<blockquote>
			"Abstraction is the elimination of the irrelevant and the amplification of the essential"
		</blockquote>
		Not only are Test Data Builders great abstractions, but they're also eminently composable. You can use fine-grained Test Data Builders as building blocks for more complex Test Data Builders. This turns out to be more than a coincidence. In this series of articles, you'll learn how Test Data Builders are closely related to the <em>identity functor</em>. If you don't know what a <a href="/2018/03/22/functors">functor</a> is, then keep reading; you'll learn about functors as well.

		By reading these articles, you'll learn the following:
		<ul>
			<li>How to make your code easier to use in unit tests.</li>
			<li>What a functor is.</li>
			<li>How Test Data Builders generalise.</li>
			<li>Why Test Data Builders are composable.</li>
		</ul>
		If you've ever struggled with defining good abstractions, learning about functors (and some related concepts) will help.

		For readers wondering if this is 'yet another monad tutorial', it's not; it's a functor tutorial.
