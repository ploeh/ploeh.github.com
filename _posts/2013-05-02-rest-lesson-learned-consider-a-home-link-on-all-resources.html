	</p>
	<p>
		This suggestion is part of my <a href="/2013/04/29/rest-lessons-learned">REST lessons learned</a> series of blog posts. Contrary to the previous posts, this advice doesn't originate from a lesson learned the hard way, but is more of a gentle suggestion.
	</p>
	<p>
		When designing a <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html">level 3</a> RESTful API, I've found that it's often helpful to think about design issues in terms of: <em>how would you design it if it was a web site?</em> On web sites, we don't ask users to construct URLs and enter them into the browser's address bar. On web sites, users follow links (and fill out forms). Many well-designed web sites are actually <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS">HATEOAS</a> services, so it makes sense to learn from them when designing RESTful APIs.
	</p>
	<p>
		One almost universal principle for well-designed web sites is that they always have a 'home' link (usually in the top left corner). It makes sense to transfer this principle to RESTful APIs.
	</p>
	<p>
		All the RESTful APIs that I've helped design so far have had a single 'home' resource, which acts as a starting point for all clients. This is the only published URL for the entire API. From that starting page, clients must follow (semantic) links in order to accomplish their goals.
	</p>
	<p>
		As an example, here's a 'home' resource on a hypothetical product catalog API:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>&lt;home xmlns="http://fnaah.ploeh.dk/productcatalog/2013/05"
      xmlns:atom="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"&gt;
  &lt;atom:link href="http://catalog.api.ploeh.dk/products/1234"
             rel="http://catalog.api.ploeh.dk/docs/rels/products/discounted" /&gt;
  &lt;atom:link href="http://catalog.api.ploeh.dk/products/5678"
             rel="http://catalog.api.ploeh.dk/docs/rels/products/discounted" /&gt;
  &lt;atom:link href="http://catalog.api.ploeh.dk/products/1337"
             rel="http://catalog.api.ploeh.dk/docs/rels/products/discounted" /&gt;
  &lt;atom:link href="http://catalog.api.ploeh.dk/categories"
             rel="http://catalog.api.ploeh.dk/docs/rels/product/categories" /&gt;
&lt;/home&gt;</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		From this (rather sparse) 'home' resource, you can view each discounted product by following the <em>discounted</em> link, or you can browse the catalog by following the <em>categories</em> link.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you follow one of the <em>discounted</em> links, you get a new resource:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>&lt;product xmlns="http://fnaah.ploeh.dk/productcatalog/2013/05"
         xmlns:atom="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"&gt;
  &lt;atom:link href="http://catalog.api.ploeh.dk"
             rel="http://catalog.api.ploeh.dk/docs/rels/home" /&gt;
  &lt;atom:link href="http://catalog.api.ploeh.dk/categories/chocolate"
             rel="http://catalog.api.ploeh.dk/docs/rels/category" /&gt;
  &lt;atom:link href="http://catalog.api.ploeh.dk/categories/gourmet"
             rel="http://catalog.api.ploeh.dk/docs/rels/category" /&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;Fine Criollo dark chocolate&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;price&gt;50 DKK&lt;/price&gt;
  &lt;weight&gt;100 g&lt;/weight&gt;
&lt;/product&gt;</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		Notice that in addition to the two <em>category</em> links, the resource representation also contains a <em>home</em> link, enabling the client to go back to the 'home' resource.
	</p>
	<p>
		Having a home link on all resources is another courtesy to the client, just like <a href="/2013/04/30/rest-lesson-learned-avoid-204-responses">avoiding 204 responses</a> - in fact, if you can't think of anything else to return instead of 204 (No Content), at the very least, you could return a home link.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the above examples, I didn't <a href="/2013/05/01/rest-lesson-learned-avoid-hackable-urls">obfuscate the URLs</a>, but I would do that for a real REST API. The reason I didn't obfuscate the URLs here is to make the example easier to understand.
