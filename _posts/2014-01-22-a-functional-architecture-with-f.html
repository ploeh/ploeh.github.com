		Whenever I've talked to object-oriented developers about F#, a common reaction has been that it looks enticing, but that they don't see how they'd be able to build a 'normal' application with it. F# has gained a reputation for being a 'niche' language, good for scientific computation and financial calculations, but not useful for mainstream applications.
	</p>
	<p>
		Not only is F# a Turing-complete, general purpose programming language, but it has <em>many</em> advantages to offer compared to, say, C#. That said, though, building a 'normal' application with F# will only make sense if you know how to work <em>with</em> the language, and define an architecture that takes advantage of all it has to offer. Therefore, I thought that it would be valuable to show one possible way to do this, through a comprehensive example.
	</p>
	<p>
		This was the motivation behind my new <a href="http://pluralsight.com">Pluralsight</a> course <a href="{{ site.production_url }}/functional-architecture-with-fsharp">A Functional Architecture with F#</a>, which is now available! In it, you'll see extensive code demos of a web application written entirely in F# (and a bit of GUI in JavaScript, but the course only shows the F# code).
	</p>
	<p>
		If you don't already have a Pluralsight account, you can get a <a href="https://pluralsight.com/training/Subscribe/Step1?isTrial=True">free trial</a> of up to 200 minutes.

	  <p>
	    What about a desktop applications written entirely in F#?  When you create a desktop applciation in F#, what do you use to create the GUI?
	  </p>
      <p>
        I am currently writting my first application in F# and need to decide what we will use to create the GUI.  There seems to be many ways this could be done.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>For simplicity, I started using WPF with the code-behind written in C#.  I am satisifed with this initial (temporary) GUI for now, but the C#/F# interop is ugly to read and painful to write.</li>
        <li>I could sitck with WPF but write the code-behind in F#.  I found two ways to do this:</li>
        <ol>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/fsprojects/FsXaml">FsXaml</a> and</li>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/elmish/Elmish.WPF">Elmish.WPF</a>.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Another <a href="https://www.davideaversa.it/2018/04/quick-look-at-f-in-unity/">possibility</a> is the video game engine <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a>.</li>
        <li>I also found a XAML-based approach called <a href="http://avaloniaui.net/">Avalonia</a>.  However, their website says they are "currently in a beta phase, which means that the framework is generally usable for writing applications, but there may be some bugs and breaking changes as we continue development."</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        There are probably many more that I missed as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Among these, Elmish.WPF stands out to me.  Their page commnicates a strong ethos, which I find both enticing and convincing.  The core idea seems to be the <a href="https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/">Elm Architecture</a>, which I have also seen expressed as the MVU architecture, where MVU stands for Model, View, Update.
      </p>
      <p>
        Have you come across that architecture before?  I am very interested to hear your opinion about it.
      </p>
      <p>
        P.S. Also worth mentioning is <a href="https://github.com/fsprojects/Fabulous">Fabulous</a>, which uses <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/">Xamarin.Forms</a>, so this seems like a good choice for mobile app development.

        Tyson, thank you for writing. I haven't done any desktop application development in ten years, so I don't think I'm qualified to make recommendations.

        Do your web applications include GUIs?  If so, what UI framework(s) do you like to use there (such as Angular, React, Elm, etc.)?
      </p>
      <p>
        P.S. I have been investigating Elmish.WPF and love what I have found.  The Elm / MVU / Model, View, Update architecture seems to be a specific (or the ultimate?) applicaiton of the functional programming prinicple of pushing impure behavior to the boundry of the applicaiton.

        Tyson, seriously, I think that the last time I wrote any GUI code was with Angular some time back in 2014, after which I walked away in disgust. Since then, I've mostly written REST APIs, with the occasional daemon and console application thrown in here and there.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many of the REST APIs I've helped develop are consumed by apps with GUIs, but someone else developed those, and I wasn't involved.
