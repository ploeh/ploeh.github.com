		<em>This post proposes a scientific experiment about code readability</em>
	</p>
	<p>
		Once in a while someone tries to drag me into one of many so-called 'religious' debates over code readability:
		<ul>
			<li>Tabs versus spaces?</li>
			<li>Where should the curly braces go?</li>
			<li>Should class members be prefixed (e.g. with an underscore)?</li>
			<li>Is the <code>this</code> C# keyword redundant?</li>
			<li>etc.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		In most cases, the argument revolves around what is most readable.
	</p>
	<p>
		Let's look at the C# keyword <code>this</code> as an example. Many programmers feel that it's redundant because they can omit it without changing the program. The compiler doesn't care. However, as <a href="http://martinfowler.com/">Martin Fowler</a> wrote in <a href="http://amzn.to/YPdQDf">Refactoring</a>: "Any fool can write code that a computer can understand.  Good programmers write code that humans can understand." Code is read much more than written, so I don't buy the argument about redundancy.
	</p>
	<p>
		There are lots of circumstances when code is read. Often, programmers read code from inside their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment">IDE</a>. This has been used as an argument against <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_notation">Hungarian notation</a>. However, at other times, you may be reading code as part of a review process - e.g. on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> or <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/">CodePlex</a>. Or you may be reading code on a blog post, or in a book.
	</p>
	<p>
		Often I feel that the <code>this</code> keyword helps me because it provides information about the scope of a variable. However, I also preach that <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2011/06/07/SOLIDCodeisnt/">code should consist of small classes with small methods</a>, and if you follow that principle, variable scoping should be easily visible on a single screen.
	</p>
	<p>
		Another argument against using the <code>this</code> keyword is that it's simply noise and that it makes it harder to read the program, simply because there's more text to read. Such a statement is <em>impossible to refute with logic</em>, because it depends on the person reading the code.
	</p>
	<p>
		Ultimately, the readability of code depends on circumstances and is highly subjective. For that reason, we can't arrive at a conclusion to any of those 'religious' debates by force of logic. However, what we <em>could</em> do, on the other hand, is to perform a set of scientific experiments to figure out what is most readable.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>A science experiment idea for future computer scientists</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		Here's an idea for a computer science experiment:
		<ol>
			<li>Pick a 'religious' programming debate (e.g. whether or not the <code>this</code> keyword enhances or reduces readability).</li>
			<li>Form a hypothesis (e.g. predict that the <code>this</code> keyword enhances readability).</li>
			<li>Prepare a set of simple code listings, each with two alternatives (with and without <code>this</code>).</li>
			<li>Randomly select two groubs of test subjects.</li>
			<li>Ask each group to explain to you what the code does (what is the result of calling a method, etc.). One group gets one alternative set, and the other group gets the other set.</li>
			<li>Measure how quickly members of each group arrives at a correct conclusion.</li>
			<li>Compare results against original hypothesis.</li>
		</ol>

				Totally agreed.
			</p> 
			<p>
				I believe that these 'religious' debates is the result of overreliance to some popular Productivity Tools. If these tools never existed those debates would appear less often.
			</p>
			<p>
				Where possible, I use <code>this</code> and <code>base</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				From a code reader's perspective, I also prefer <code>this</code> since I can immediately understand whether a member of a class is either a static member or an instance member. After all, it is possible to prefix a static member with <code>_</code> but not with <code>this</code>.

			<p>The import thing that emerges from this interesting post is that readabiliy is a <strong>key feature</strong> of code.</p>

			<p>I'm a fun of this concept: <strong>code is meant to be read</strong>. A person able to program is not a programmer, like a person able to write is not a writer.</p>

			<p>The good compromise is common sense.</p>

			<p>The scenitifical experiment proposed could give use misleading informations, since the <i>human factor</i> is a problematic variable to put into the equation (not to mention <i>Heisenberg</i>); but I would be curious to see results.</p>

			</p>Coming back to the <code>this</code> keyword, my personal opinion is that it can be omitted, if your naming convention supplies a readable alternative (like the <code>_</code> underscore prefix before private instance members).</p>
