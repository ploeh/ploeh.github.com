<div id="post">
	<p>In the last couple of years, there's been a lot of debate in the community on the philosophy behind TDD and where to put the emphasis  -  even to the point of debating whether the acronym stands for Test-Driven <em>Development</em> or Test-Driven <em>Design</em>.</p> <p>Other people don't like the emphasis on <em>tests</em>, since that makes TDD sound like a Testing discipline, and not a Development discipline. Instead, they prefer terms like <em>Example-Driven Design/Development</em> (EDD) or even <em>Design by Example</em> (DbE).</p> <p>This view seems to me to be particularly prevalent in Microsoft, where there's a rather sharp distinction between developers and testers (job titles to the contrary)  -  I guess that's one of the reasons why <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/xunit">xUnit.net</a> (a project initiated by Microsoft employees) uses the attribute <em>Fact</em> instead of <em>Test</em> or <em>TestMethod</em>.</p> <p>For people used to SCRUM or other agile methodologies, this distinction is more blurred, and they also seem to accept the <em>T</em> in TDD more willingly.</p> <p>However, the adherents of EDD claim that the mere presence of the word <em>test</em> make some developers block any further input and stop listening. They may be right in that.</p> <p>They also claim that the <em>tests</em> in TDD/EDD are nothing more than accidental artifacts of the development <em>process</em>, and hence argue that we shouldn't call them <em>tests</em> at all. However, if that's true, <a href="http://ayende.com/Blog/archive/2007/10/19/Test-Once-The-other-side-of-continuous-integration.aspx">this little story</a> related by <a href="http://ayende.com/Blog/Default.aspx">Ayende</a> must be an example of EDD in its purest form :)</p> <p>To me, the tests are <em>also</em> important. Since 2003 I've been practicing TDD, and while I love how it helps me arrive at better design, I also savor the safety net that my suite of tests gives me. The tests that I write during TDD define the <em>behavior</em> of the software. In many cases, I'd even claim that such a regression test suite is more valuable than a Quality Assurance (QA) regression test suite  -  after all, a QA suite may catch some edge cases, but they don't focus on the intended <em>behavior</em> of the system, but often more on how to break it - but I digress…</p> <p>My recent posts on <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2009/03/03/DerivedValuesEnsureExecutableSpecification.aspx">Executable Specification</a> and <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2009/03/05/ConstrainedNonDeterminism.aspx">Constrained Non-Determinism</a> help explain my current stance in this debate: In my opinion, EDD fails to establish a relationship by not providing <a href="http://xunitpatterns.com/Derived%20Value.html">Derived Values</a>. After all, what does a test like the following specify?</p><!--

<p>How would you implement the Invert method? Here's one possible implementation:</p><!--

<p>Obviously, you could now write a new test that gives a <em>second</em> example of input and outcome and force me to write a more sophisticated algorithm. However, with only two examples, I might still be tempted to write a switch statement with some hard-coded return values until you've written so many ‘examples' that you've coerced me into writing the more general (and correct) algorithm.</p>
<p>Such an approach I find inefficient.</p>
<p>Instead, by using Constrained Non-Determinism to force myself to define Derived Values, each test fully <em>specifies</em> the desired behavior. It doesn't provide <em>examples</em>. It provides the <em>specification</em>, and instead of having to write several similar examples to coerce a general algorithm to emerge, I can usually nail it in a single test.</p>
<p>This approach could be styled Specification-Driven Development, and that's how I've been writing code for the last year or so.</p>

	<div class="comment-content">Just a comment... Remember the pattern in TDD: Red, Green, Refactor. You're not supposed to write a second test in order to force you to remove the hardcoded return &quot;heolp&quot;; implementation. You're supposed to remove duplication during the refactoring stage. The constant &quot;heolp&quot; is duplicated in the test and in the implementation code, and according to Kent Beck this is your main focus during refactoring; to eliminate duplication. </div>

	<div class="comment-content">Hi Torbj&#248;rn<br>
<br>
Thank you for your comment.<br>
<br>
First of all: I'm a big believer in the Red/Green/Refactor cycle, so we're totally on the same page there!<br>
<br>
As the test in the example stands, the constant &quot;heolp&quot; is most certainly duplicated across test and implementation code, until the point when I decide to implement the Invert method correctly. So far I can only agree, but partially because my example is so simple: Once again I fall into the trap that my example is too simple, but had I made it more complex, I'd have lost my reader(s) long ago.<br>
<br>
One or few 'examples' would be enough to clue anyone on to the fact that the intended algorithm of the Invert method is to invert the input. It's fairly obvious.<br>
<br>
Imagine, instead, that we're testing a hypothetical CalculateRocketTrajectory method. Yes, we're attempting to implement a Domain Model over rocket science! Unless you <i>are</i> a rocket scientist, it's likely that it's going to take a pretty big amount of 'examples' before you can figure out what is the underlying algorithm. It would be much more efficient if each test could simply <i>specify</i> the relationship between input and output.<br>
<br>
Yes, that would lead to a bit of duplication across the test code and the implementation code, but I prefer that to the alternative. In my experience, most software development isn't about algorithm development anyway; it's about API design, Domain Modeling, handling corner cases, moving and transforming data, etc.<br>
<br>
This is not to say that I am right and you are wrong. Here, I'm mainly trying to describe what motivates me to work in a certain way, so please feel free to keep the discussion going!</div>

	<div class="comment-content">I expect you have much more actual experience with TDD (or EDD or DbE or BDD) then myself. Since I just read Beck's TDD book and had it fresh in mind, I just wanted to give my comment, for your readers mostly, since I felt that part of the pattern wasn't represented in your post.<br>
<br>
Keep up the nice posts.., enjoying your blog!</div>

<br>
Thanks again. You point was valid and well taken.<br>
<br>
One of the reasons I find EDD ineffecient stems from my experience with The XP Game, which is enjoyable, but a bit too much on the back-and-forth side for my tastes.<br>
<br>
YMMV, so I'm not trying to dictate what anyone should do - I'm just trying to demonstrate that there are more than one way to do TDD.</div>
